long descriptions - indexes,"dave one item that was left open after my meeting with  d  .   this morning was what the index should look like and how much input we have had from the confirm desk  .   my inclination was that the index should be the same language that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the gtc taken together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous contract  .    felt that the index should provide a more complete description than the short description abbreviation but that the full  text could wait for the paper confirm  .  given 's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine as far as they go and has not attempted to corr them with the full  language  .   said he would be contacting you himself but i thought it might make sense to give you my version as well  .  what are your thoughts if you'd like to discuss, i will be in by 9 00 tomorrow but have a meeting at 10 and then the meeting with all of the lawyers and  to discuss the further long description review at 11  ."

human rights watch,i haven't seen any of the press reports (even though i am in london and i hear that's where they were) but i thought this was a well drafted response  .   the only additional rumours i have heard indicate that the police may have been rough in their handling of demonstrators outside the fence at the plant construction site  .   i remember hearing that there were times that the construction workers feared for their lives because of the vehemence of the protesters  .   i guess that didn't make it into the (ever heard of them ) report  .

uk courts vs. arbitration for uk swap agreements,"the response from richard is that we are happy with uk courts so long as our counterparty is in the uk, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of uk courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should go to arbitration  .   in other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up in court in a jurisdiction in europe  .  let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when i'm in london  ."

elimination of confirmations for eol transactions,"no, the eta says that if you have a master agreement in place it governs trades in the relevant commodities  .   in fact, we used that language to mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms when they first signed up for enrononline  .   to the extent we want to eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters, we will need their agreement  .   from a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms for gtc-governed transactions without asking the customer first  .   whether or not that is a good idea from a customer relations/eting/pr view i will leave to others  .   since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally available  .    /enron enronxgate 04/25/2001 08 41 am"

legal agreement,my analysis is that forcing the scroll through the entire agreement provides additional comfort that the counterparty has actually looked at the agreement and knows to what they are agreeing - it is that much more likely that the contract will be enforceable  .   it is certainly not necessary from my point of view that the document take up the entire page rather than appearing in a smaller window with a scroll bar down the side - in fact i think that looks much better  .   it would be acceptable from a  point of view if the agree button appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work until the agreement had been scrolled through  .   i personally think that would create more problems from a commercial point of view since many counterparties will try to click on agree as soon as it appears without reading the agreement and get frustrated when it doesn't work right away  .   david - do you agree  09/28/99 03 55 pm

end of year bonus,"please disregard if you received an email from mehaving trouble with the network in houston)dave,the attached spreadsheet outlines my recommendations on proposed changes to the bonus distribution  .  in regard to my expectations, i am expecting a significant increase from last years bonus for the following reason  .  it was my strategic decision to pursue the asset development business in conjunction with other business lines (made and received approval to hire the necessary people and execute the strategy from kevin hannon)  .  close both wind and powder projects simultaneously versus only focus on the powder river project (know one thought that both could get done in a 7 week time frame  .   at the risk of not being able to get either closed, i went out on the limb and sent whitt to negotiate and close wind river ($72 mm) while i negotiated and closed powder river ($75 mm)  .  it was my idea to create enron midstream services and develop a gathering business in the powder  .   that decision enable us to hedge our firm transport decision on fort union and enabled us to receive $54 million for the sale of the businessi made the call and initiated the joint bid between northern border and ena to acquire a combined 49% interest in bighorn gas gathering  .   we sold our interest to nbp for $22 mmi initiated the discussions, structured the transaction, negotiated the value and closed project 20/20 with nbp  .   there was a point in the negotiations where it was known that i was going with nbp and therefore had to take a neutral position  .   however, by that time, the value had been established and many contentious issues regarding valuation had been agreed uponit was my call to preserve value in the transaction and have myself and a team of 12 others go over to nbp versus have them deduct the cost associated with a management services agreement from the purchase price  .   this saved ena over $20 mm in value  .   needless to say, we are now having to deal with managing a highly aggressive budget and adjust to a very different management style and compensation plan  .   i feel personally that ena was the primary beneficiary of the higher valuation  .   as you can appreciate, i have a personal issue with this and would like this to be considered for bonus determination  .  in general, i think project 20/20 was just part of my contribution to ena during my tenure in denver  .   in total, this office has generated in excess of $150 million in earnings with no remaining risk potential  .   i have been fortunate to have hired a solid team that approached many of the projects we worked on in a team manner  .   i think that approach has been successful and i am hopeful that major contributors on the team will be compensated appropriately  .  i appreciate your consideration dave  !   please let me know if you have any questions or thoughts regarding this email  ."

valuation of ga activities,"/ you asked that we attempt to evaluate our activities  .   working with tw, i've valued this one  .  the california commission ruled that the hector road natural gas recent point in california ought to be made a primary receipt point  .   this would have had the effect of tw losing access right to 200 mmcf/d of capacity at socalgas' needles receipt point  ."
observations on the hearings this week,"we're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months  .   but while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on monday and tuesday, i wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead  .  observation--the pressure to finger somebody for price gouging is increasing  .  the administration is hell bent on finding a fall guy  .   the price spikes pose real political risks for davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out  .   his press release following the hearing renewed the call for refunds  .   on my panel, loretta lynch asked reliant and duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers  .   and carl wood's remarks were extreme  .  at the barton hearing, a liberal democrat (filner) and a conservative republican (hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds  .   bilbray joined the gouging band wagon  .  the utilities repeatedly called on ferc to do a real investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works  .   on the positive side, the ferc commissioners lauded wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel  .   wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of california's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit  .   he also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure  .  implication--it seems prudent for enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered  .  in the best case, the clamoring for a refund subsides  .   in which case, the only cost to enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered  .  in the medium case, investigations find that enron (like others) played by the rules, but the rules stunk, and enron profited at the expense of california consumers  ."

california update--07.20.01,"having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues, the legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at a minimum  .  in sum, though many claim that the legislature will vote for something, it still doesn't appear that the something will include a measure that will keep edison out of bankruptcy  .  the senate and assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to amending the governor's original mou (which is dead)  .  the ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is growing  .  in the senate sb18xx---bill to de-link the bonds from the dwr contractsin the only bipartisan move to date, sb18xx passed out of two committees yesterday, but has not yet been voted on by the full senate  .   the bill de-links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget from payment of dwr contracts  .  the bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of the dwr contracts  .  the dwr contracts are being held up as the reason california must suspend, or end, direct access  .  republicans on the assembly side are supportive of 18, but hertzberg--the speaker--has joined with the governor's people in the view that the bill would impair the contracts, consititute a breach, and expose the state to substantial damages  .  as a result, when the bill passes the senate and gets over to the assembly, its chances of passage there are low  .  sb72xx---the senate's mouthe senate's version of the mou--sb72xx--limped out of its final committee yesterday before going to a vote by the full senate, but its chances of passing the full senate at this point are 50-50  .  the problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting for a bill that will likely drive edison into bankruptcy, while many other democrats fear it will look like they bailed out edison----the courage and leadership is awesome  .  in the assembly the assembly two versions of the mou---ab 82xx and ab 83 xx (now ab 50xx)the assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue  .  the speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his own bill (82xx)  .  many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat (rod wright), who has broken ranks with repbublicans, and assembly republicans  .  in the end, the speaker's bill is likely to prevail  .  things are complicated by the fact that the assembly is having a very difficult time getting a budget passed  .  as noted above, the assembly democractic leadership opposes sb 18xx and is trying to cobble together an alternative to 18  ."
assembly goes in at 4pm today,"quick add on to sue's note right now, appears they're focused on the budget, but could take up energy  .   there appears to continue to be considerable uncertainty----seems that even many democratic assembly members don't know at this point what the plan is for this afternoon/evening  .   our lobbyists are attempting to get more info, which we'll pass on soon as we get it  .  best,  j  07/23/2001 11 38 am"

switching customers back to ldc,"greetings recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a ca puc staffer asking whether we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the ldc  .   we looked into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two different utilities  .   we informed the puc staffer of the mix-up and explained that the situation would be resolved  .   the questions from the staffer arose because the ca puc made a bad decision a couple of months ago  .   when gas prices ran up at the california border a lot of large ( noncore ) customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff in the hope of lowering gas costs  .   in response, socalgas filed with the commission asking the puc to prohibit customers from switching back  .   the commission agreed and put the prohibition in place  .   the commission is now concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, customers won't have the option of returning to ldc service  .  today, i received a letter from the president of the commission asking me to respond to the following have you stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or  .  notified any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing natural gas commodity procurement contract  .   if your company has stopped or intends to stop serving non-core customers, the cpuc also needs to knowhow many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminatethe natural gas volumes involvedthe location of the non-core customer(s)the reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those contracts  .   there's a good chance that the letter from the president of the commission is linked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers back to utility service in california  .   prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the commissioner, i'm trying to get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the utility prior to expiration, choosing not to renew contracts once they've expired, etc  .   , or jim , can you help out"

legal analysis on ab 1890,"i think it's fuzzy enough that two good lawyers could give two different views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered  .   but i just talked to mike and he and i think, at least preliminarily, that the puc could do this absent legislation  .   he's going to do the analysis  .   likely better to let mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions, we can make that decision at that time  ."

possible messages on legislation in california,"here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing our relationships or commercial prospects  .  overall, we respect the effort, but california failed to get the ball over the goal line on sitingintentionally or not, california has designed power plant siting laws that make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state  .   folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental quality in california  .  that's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are going outside the state to build power plants  .   tinkering around the edges won't help and (with all due respect) the legislation passed yesterday tinkers  .  real reform is required if california hopes to build the supply necessary to keep pace with silicon valley and a high tech culture and tame the price spikes  .  if developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a dozen--or more--state and local agencies, california's supply problems will continue, or worsen  .  california needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now  .  on the retail price capthey don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so i won't repeat them hear)the press has already reported that the measure the legislature passed simply puts off the day of reckoning  .  it's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your door to collect  .  now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a couple of years down the road  .  so san diegans who continue to take service from sdg&e will pay the same amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use electricity wisely  .  there's a better answer instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with another retail provider  .   clearly, the biggest mistake california made was the press and decision makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals with companies like enron  .   but for the press reports, they hardly know there's a crisis  ."

tw letter agreement,"here is the draft letter agreement  .   we are still discussing it with ecs and can make whatever changes are appropriate  .   note that the letter agreement ties back to article 6 of the compression services agreement  .   that article, you may recall, is where ecs agreed to create a computerized system that would monitor continental divide's electric system utilization and warn when their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor offline (subject to manual override) so we and ecs could avoid peak period demand charges  .   instead of creating such a system, which apparently turned out to be mostly a manual system anyway, ecs is going to pay us a monthly fee to monitor cd's system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off line  .   the load management service has to do with operational management of the load we place on cd's electric system, and is not a jurisdictional gas transportation or storage service  .   note that the service goes on for 10 years (as required by the accountants' 10 year amortization rule) and thus may be vulnerable to scrutiny and potential revenue crediting in tw's 2007 rate case  .   any way to avoid that df"
daily california update.....,"cpuc votes to keep gas flowinga special session yesterday of california's regulators gave pg&e's utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past feb  .   7 when the current federal doe emergency order expires, but it postponed action on another pg&e request that southern california gas co  .   which has strongly objected be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the pg&e utility's residential and small business customers  .   loretta lynch, president of the california public utilities commission, said pg&e's utility is a victim a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers, now demanding payment for future supplies up front not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills, but because the electricity crisis has sapped its creditworthiness  .   the cpuc action allows pg&e's utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or, in effect, a lien, in the utility's retail customers' bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with pg&e's gas utility operations while the creditworthiness of the company itself is dubious  .   it won't be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts, that it will know if the cpuc action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation, according to pg&e gas utility spokesperson staci homrig  .   on the operational side, pg&e on wednesday declared a lowinventory ofo because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system  .   the action was thought to help cause the pg&e citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on wednesday  .   as for reports of low storage, homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, they are adequate for the next week  .   they are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point, homrig said  .   lynch said that pg&e has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided  .   these gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh, lynch said in voting for the securitization measure  .   suppliers who have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 'pay us today  .  ' they are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow pg&e amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing  .   part of the cpuc's action places a 90day limit on the securitization option, so with the way gas contracts work, in effect, it only provides about another 30 days' worth of supplies, said homrig, who noted that almost all of pg&e's 25 to 30 suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements (advances, cashondelivery or letters of credit) that the company cannot accommodate because of its cashflow crisis  .   out of ongoing negotiations, the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables, thus, assuring them they will get paid  .   on the gas side, pg&e has had sufficient revenues unlike its electric business but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe creditrating decline in the past weeks  .   the cpuc met in san francisco late wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor, state legislature, consumer groups, regulators and utilities  .   a key piece was missing, however  .   california state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis  .   reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business  .   a spokesman for the assembly speaker's office said he had no idea when the briefing would be rescheduled  .   one piece of legislation that got through the state senate (sb 1x) yesterday authorizes another $500 million in emergency funds to purchase power  .   it also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities' wholesale power supplier under longterm contracts at least through 2002  .   the measure drew a protest from cpuc commissioner richard bilas, who argued that the state agency be removed from that role as quickly as possible  .   the bill, which was first passed by the state assembly, was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate  .   it then would have to be ratified again by the assembly  .   meanwhile, consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bailout of the privatesector utilities  .   this prompted at least one of the utilities, southern california edison, to come out swinging, saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any windfall profits or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company  .   a letter surfaced in washington from gov  .   gray davis to the senate energy and natural resources committee, dated jan  .   30 and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand, sign longterm contracts and maintain the financial viability of the state's public utilities  .   the letter, a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here, contained no specifics on any longterm contracts nor legislation signed that would address the immediate problem  .   davis outlined measures being taken to speed up siting of new power plants, saying an additional 2,000 mw would be online by the end of the year  .   responding to questions on another arena, edison international's senior vice president tom higgins said everything is on the table in the ongoing negotiations between davis' threeperson negotiating team and the two utilities, including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in los angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities' own generation against the whopping wholesale power cost undercollections  .   the state remained under a power watch for the 16th day as the california independent grid operator (caliso) urged conservation because reserves remain very low  ."

supplemental ndg comments in rm98-10,"the whole thing also bugs me on an intuitive level, but i'm not sure it is a legal conflict of interest  .   the northern cases he is involved in are not really gisb matters  .   there are certainly issues like the 637 compliance issue that involve gisb standards, however  .   gisb is a freestanding entitity and his representation does not equate to representation of enron so he could claim that his only client interest to worry about is gisb itself  .   as long as he does not take positions in northern cases that are inconsistent with what gisb wants, he's technically ok  .   i suspect he'd argue that his work in the northern docket is completely consistent with gisb's objective of achieving world domination  .   this was my from the hip analysis when jay first showed up in our cases, so i may have missed something  .   for example, i'm not really clear on gisb's structure  .   can we argue that it is not a real stand alone entity but rather a front for a cooperative group of companies that includes enron if so, we might have a real conflict  ."

moving thoughts (words of wisdom),"some thoughts that might help from time to time  .   this was forwarded to me, and i found it very compelling  .  gmaybe god wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift  .   when the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us  .   the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had  .   it's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives  .   giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back  !   don't expect love in return just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours  .   it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone  .   don't go for looks they can deceive  .   don't go for wealth even that fades away  .   go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright  .   find the one that makes your heart smile  .   there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real  !   dream what you want to dream go where you want to go be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do  .   may you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy  .   always put yourself in others' shoes  .   if you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too  .   the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything they just make the most of everything that comes along their way  .   happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives  .   love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear  .   the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches  .   when you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling  .   live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying  .   please send this message to those people who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship  .   and if you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message  ."

"upstream energy services cio, l.l.c.","brian riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that hpl had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508  .  61and would it be appropriate for hpl to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to upstream  .   the documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998  .   the 1997 payments were made pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a day however, killam oil company, the operator of the wells, has made a reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that upstream represents to enron oil and gas company  .   the information provided does not indicate when killam made the reallocation  .   based on the reallocation, hpl or its predecessor has paid upstream for 97,384 mmbtu that has now been allocated to eog  .   i am told that upstream has not denied its responsibility for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from the parties that it represents  .   upstream's attorney, ty kelly written correspondence indicates that the spot contract was not complete because it did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes  .   that contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation evidencing the transaction  .   he also stated that the volumes should have been sold to hpl under the big cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy of  .   brian riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the big cowboy and the spot contract  .   kelly also indicated that since hpl's agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved through arbitration  .  based on my review of the information available, hpl should withhold the sum of $328,508  .  61 from the next payment to be made to upstream and hold such sum in suspense until the issue is resolved  .   hpl needs to be aware that in the event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to remit such amount together with interest to upstream  ."

calpine cogeneration facility(s) relations,"texas city facility - the relationship between hpl and calpine has become and continues to be strained  .   calpine purchased the texas city cogeneration facility from enron and dominion resources in early 1998  .   prior to that time ena supplied 45,000 mmbtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a market price agreement was in place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to that which union carbide corporation had the contractual right to supply under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the facility  .   after calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were terminated  .   at this point hpl became the sole supplier to the facility although the interconnection with the union carbide delivery point with the calpine facility remained active and a new transaction agreement was put in place whereby calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in volumes  .   since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and calpine has shortpaid hpl's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts invoiced were correct  .   additionally, as a result of calpine's power purchaser's last minute notification to calpine of reductions in the purchase of power for the next day, which notification is usually after calpine's next day notification deadline to hpl, calpine has resorted to the use of creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs  .   these notifications have occurred some thirteen (i think) times and calpine has provided little explanation to hpl of the nature of these events of force majeure  .   when pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking valves, etc  .  clear lake facility - the relationship between calpine and hpl is not as strained with regard to deliveries at this facility  .   this may be because the contract covering the base volume of gas being delivered by hpl has not changed since it was negotiated by ena in 1995  .   midcon remains connected to the facility and delivers certain quantities of market priced gas  .   market priced gas is required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes supplied under the 1995 agreement  .   should the power purchase agreement be amended to allow calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser cancel the power purchase agreement, calpine has negotiated an amendment allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery points  .   currently, hpl has advised calpine of an upcoming event of force majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the a-s pipeline  .   it is not known whether the midcon delivery point has the capacity to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not  ."

taub lawsuit project triple lux,"richard sanders and i talked with elizabeth (an attorney with aep)  .   she was not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered  .   richard opined that the question may have related to the effect on hpl if it lost the taub lawsuit  .   this suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface rights agreement (collateral agreement) which was entered into with certain surface owners after the unit agreement was signed  .   richard explained that if hpl lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit  .   in that event hpl would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or use its condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property  .   because the collateral agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would not affect hpl's rights under the unit agreement and thus the taubs would not have the right to drill a well to produce the gas that hpl has in storage  ."

cuiaba epc/changeorders - please respond,i like this conceptually as an approach to manage costs but see the potential plems with shell if eecc is paid on time  .   i think it may also be extremely difficult to rework the ld's because the eecc wrap does not match up with the subs very well (in some cases eecc's protection exceeds the subs and in other is less)  .   i also wonder who is the credit for contractor obligations in this scenario for the lenders  e 01/20/2001 09 31 am
dresdner kleinwort benson potential conflict of interest,graham just called back and said that the rio m&a people were engaged by petras to review other enron asset sales ( i think this implies elektro and the ldc's) and it was only recently that we requested that petras consider cuiaba as well  .   in any case he assured me that there is a strong chinese wall between the project finance group and the m&a group so it is unlikely that they could obtain any info as a result  .   he assured me that they will make everyone aware of the need for increased care on cuiaba information handling due to this situation  .   let me know if you require more  .   it is my understanding that neal provided similar reasuarance at your meeting today  .

interconnection agreements,", i think the supplemental info you have provided is outstanding and helpful to the lenders in understanding the overall picture and the history  .   however, its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as i understand it  .   the lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically about third party liability meaning, i believe, lawsuits or claims from parties who did not receive power because cuiaba failed to generate  .   therefore, i think the questions which tozzinni needs to address are along the lines of   .   if epe is required to sign the agreements by aneel, what is the extent of damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements   .   could any consequential damages be assessed   .   could epe excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid documents, the ppa or other agreements with furnas, electronote or eletrabras   .   how would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement which was payable by epe could the process be expedited to avert a liquidity crisis   .   could epe be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a spot market price assessed by the mae stemming from an unscheduled outage   .   similarly, could epe incur penalties or be denied transmission if they failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of the agreements   .   will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons (such as access to back-up power) which would be excluded from the protections by furnas under the ppa   .   could furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability 10) a question for insurance - does our business interuption insurance"

gd tiered deals,"fyi, please book all future gd priced tiered deals as two deals in sitara  .   the reason for this is eventhough we put a swap on the deal for the volume that should be at index, the swap looks at the volume as a monthly volume as opposed to a daily and gives the monthly volume to the desk at mid  .   what typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes to the desk entirely at mid  .   this is causing some substantial oa variances  .   if you have any questions, please let me know  ."

sitara deal locations,"i wanted to ask a favor  .   would you mind reminding your group to please let us know when they change a pipe or trading zone or add a location to a deal in sitara  .   if we do not catch this change, the trader will be getting the deal at contract instead of mid, because the swap does not automatically update when you change the physical deal  .   if the change is simply a meter, that will not effect the pricing of the deal  ."
changing deal locations,"i have a favor to ask  .   would you mind asking your team to email or phone me when they make a location change on a deal in sitara  .   we had a case yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal and for the hedge  .   the point was incorrect and a person in logistics corrected it  .   the problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will then value the deal in the trader's book at mid  .   if the locations are different, it will value the deal at the customer price  .   this could potentially have a large impact on the trader's p&l  .   it does not seem pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing deal locations due to time constraints  .   we will be more than happy to make the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first place when we calc our books  .   i would greatly appreciate your groups help in cutting some of these issues off at the pass  .   if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to give me a shout  ."

interviews,i think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole program  .   either that or ted's buying time to go out and find more candidates  .   it's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing thus far  .   i'm too chickenshit to ask phillip  .   early today three of the six people i interviewed with were in my area talking  .  its sucks just knowing that they know and aren't offering any info  .

synthetic storage,",i'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging  .   each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market  .   then that day's transactions can be entered to calculate the p & l of transactions which close out previous positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions  .   initially, i thought that daily p&l could be calculated by simply adjusting the p&l whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time value and storage costs would be included)  .   however, this only works if the person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking  .   as the seller of utilizing 100% hedging, i should be able to do this, except for the fact that i will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there  .   the main question i have is simply, should i be calculating the p&l for each person's storage book for open and closed positions then beyond that, if we do calculate the p&l's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage is not hedged, i will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it  .   so, i guess i could apply the model for that purpose  .   does this make sense to you any comments are appreciated  ."
hola,"steve,i'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - definitely restricts the possibilities  .   what are the chances of a follow-on tour won't the contract be renewed if your tour was indeed over, would how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company  .   the later the better for me, but seriously, i could probably get on plane next weekend if that was the only opportunity  .   i'll give a call sometime, but i don't think i have the number anywhere  .   can you send it to me fyi, my numbers"

solver licence key,",i took a few days off and just got back  .  anyway, i haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then i'm sure it does  .   one thing i'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even when it does work  .   in order to get the full benefit of your model i want to run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters  .   so, if you haven't guessed already, i'm wondering how hard it would be to get this thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the results without me tending to it  .   i envision a spreadsheet where i list out all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, then steps to the next set of variables  .   in this way i could set it to run a bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day  .   would this be just a separate macro what do you think om  enron02/22/2001 08 01 am"

book review,"reviewed by mark williams, svp riskmanagement, citizens powerthe long awaited second edition of managing energyprice risk has finally arrived  .   it has been four yearssince the first edition was published  .   during this hiatus,a lot has happened as risk management within therapidly expanding energy industry has come of age asa respected discipline  .   the second edition is a richcompilation of papers by a surprisingly representativegroup of industry leaders, practitioners and academics  .  the books strength is that it reinforces the fact thatrisk management principles initially applied to a narrowband of energy commodities can and should be appliedacross a wide array of energy commodities includingelectricity  .   as expected the book does a solid job incapturing an international perspective on the variouschallenges, which are not isolated to any onecontinent but are global in scope  .   it includes a lengthyintroduction that effectively frames risk managementprogress, advancements and innovations that startedin the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to thenatural gas and most recently expanding to theelectricity industry  .  managing energy price risk is comprised of 15chapters, all of which include an introduction, whichminimises the disjointedness that you may expect froma book written by a large number of authors  .   otherimprovements in this second edition include expandedgraphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and aseparate glossary, which provides the reader withadditional reference material  .  in particular the chapter on energy options written bymichael hampton is a useful primer and provides thereader with a concise explanation of option theory,pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practicalguidelines for distinguishing between hedging and purespeculation  .   for the more advanced reader, thechapter on energy exotic options, written by ,   and   isparticularly strong as it outlines the challengesassociated with the exotics and effectively documentsthe latest methods used by leading practitioners inpricing such instruments  .  additionally, the chapter on accounting for derivativecontracts in the energy environment by threeconsultants from arthur anderson, is a well writtensummary which addresses the numerous tax relatedissues including a timely discussion on the us financialaccounting standards board's statement 133 (seeeprm october 1999, page 22)  .   having this taxinformation housed in one concise chapter is of greatvalue  .  the second edition however is not without flaws  .   inparticular, it would have been useful to have moreinformation on the current challenges risk managersare confronted with in the power industry includinglatest advancements in volatility and correlationestimation techniques  .   additional attention could havealso been placed on the shortcomings of the currentmarket structure and methods in finding and applyingappropriate hedging strategies and instruments  .   in thefledgling power market, this continues to be one of theprimary challenges  .  in summary, this second edition of managing energyprice risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in theprior edition and is a valuable reference book for thenew recruit or seasoned veteran  .   it is a welcomeedition to any risk management library  ."

reminder,"while i don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of these negative experiences, i do feel the highlighted section below is now more appropriate than ever  .  one must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when they trust  .   just as i suggested that positive experiences can cause one's level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause irreparable harm  .   if you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is violated it colours every aspect of your life  .   there are too many people in this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times that trust was thrown back in their face  .   i don't mean to suggest from the above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses  .   i have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a great deal more about them and their character  .   the smallest acts and statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant  .   (this includes listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of people whom you respect  .  )to that end i have one last comment  .  i am constantly amazed and periodically reminded what fragile creatures we humans are  .   that beyond the hype and self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, cares, concerns, needs etc  .  ) cannot be completely disregarded and will always be a part of us  .   i think that only by recognizing those components and trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger  ."

duke,", i've been studying the el paso/dynegy reservation reduction mechanism (rrm)  .   basically the deal was that dynegy's minimum-pay obligation would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of it revenues generated by el paso's transportation of it volumes above a historical threshold  .   (the parties based the threshold on el paso's monthly it volumes for the 12 months ended 9/30/97  .  ) the volumes in excess of the threshold were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the total volumes was determined the ratio would then be applied to the fixed cost component of all it revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to dynegy's monthly reservation charge, to the extent dynegy had not met its minimum pay obligation for a particular month  .  this provision of course met with heavy opposition however, ferc allowed it  .   ferc stated that while the rrm had anticompetitive effects because it created a disincentive for el paso to discount it, it was not unduly discriminatory  .   the unduly discriminatory conclusion was based on an analysis on the potential effect on the cal  .   gas transportation market -- the commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither dynegy nor el paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much firm capacity was available  .  i assume russ may be after something similar to the rrm  .   we would have to file it as a negotiated rate but i feel fairly confident that we could get ferc to accept it  .   that's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue  .  i'll come down around 3 30 to chat with you more about the (i have a conference call with mkm from 1 30 to 3 30, which is why i'm camped out on 47)  ."

efbh service approved,"-- i'm working on a checklist  .  there were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market services, weren't there one having to do with whether we want to change our 68 a to reflect fts-1 and fts-3 in same bucket -- i'm leaning towards not changing since the language is already general enough to cover us there  .  the other issue had to do with issuing the ofo if efbh does not show up in the last cycle  .   i do not believe any changes are necessary there either  .   the tariff language as it's currently written says we shall issue an ofo, and we would, but an ofo issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality and the efbh shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty  .  if you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27a and 68a), or if there are any other issues we need to address, let me know  .   also, if you want to sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later this afternoon, i'm available  ."

gallup answers,"here is the quick & dirty  .  none of the gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not placed in service by a certain date  .   the respective obligations of the parties do not commence until the facilities are tested and placed in service  .   we notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the facilities were in service  .   the compressor has since been taken down because of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin  .   ee&cc does not know how long it will take to correct the problems they do not have enough information yet to even give an estimate  .   based on our experience with hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem  .   today, we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not exceed our existing capacity  .   nominations are expected to exceed existing capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate  .  given the uncertainty involved, from a pr standpoint i believe it would be best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis  .   when the compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know  ."

contract issue,", i wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our consultant, mark baldwin of igs  .   our consulting agreement with igs (which has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated using the net present value of any contract identified by igs and entered into during the term of the consulting agreement  .   during the term of the agreement, tw entered into its gallup expansion agreement with southern  .   igs is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive fee  .   while it is undisputed that mark discussed the deal with southern, southern was also on lorraine's list of shippers to contact for gallup expansion capacity  .   also, the capacity was posted for all to see  .   so, while mark can certainly claim he identified the deal, he was not alone in doing so  .   steve is going to call mark in response to his letter (after he talks to lorraine to verify facts)  .   our thinking is that if we offer igs some money they will be happy  .   we would really like to preserve what has been a good working relationship with this consultant  .   on the other hand, i think we could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive fee  .   however, since the contract is silent as to whether igs has to be the only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, this position is not as strong as i'd like it to be, and igs might sue tw  .   the amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we use in calculating net present value  .  if you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to igs, let me know  .   i think it will be very important for steve not to admit that mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do decide to take us to court  ."
transport options on tw,"attached is the latest draft of the transport option program filing  .   after our discussion last week i made a couple of significant changes from the last draft  .  one is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be market-based  .   instead i have tried to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee  .   the other significant change is that i've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on tw, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option  .   in other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a maxdtq of zero  .   if you don't think i've explained this clearly enough, let me know  .  i'm meeting informally with the commercial group next week to discuss 1) some examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers  .   i'll circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas or questions  .  as i've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns  .   i realize there is some concern about showing them our filing  .   what if we just show them our final tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss their questions let me know what you think  .  our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting first, and when ferc staff is available to talk  ."

tw comment on rehearing request,"with regard to the commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that are now subject to rofr  .   the commission's rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re-execute current contracts  .   the tw commercial group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts  .   in limiting the right of first refusal, the commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate  .   shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of rofr, and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract  .   in light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the rofr rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts  .   such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an as amended basis)  .   consistent with the commission's order, it would not be unfair to make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of the contract  ."

daily firm on tw,"the commercial group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year  .   the standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the fts-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date  .   typically tw enters into these discount letters for a term of one month  .   the marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term  .   i see no basis for this limitation  .   the term of the fts-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day  .   the discount is only applicable for so long as the fts-1 agreement renews  .   if the fts-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable  .   the basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the fts-1 agreement  .   we are not guaranteeing a shipper daily firm for longer than a one-day term  .   the discount letter merely states that, for so long as the fts-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date  .  does this make sense i realize you are swamped, but i need to get steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable  .   drew and i have discussed this and he is on board  ."

trip to london next week,"brent price and i will be in the london office next week, arriving monday morning and returning to houston on friday  .   the purpose of my visit is in regard to my global risk management operations role, i believe that rick causey met with you regarding some operations support that brent and i will provide to fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of michael jordan, the jp morgan staffer that fernley has hired  .   brent and i will be working with fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for fernley during that transition period  .   we will also map out an enron trading operations introduction for michael jordan, which may involve a short stint for him in houston  .   my goal is to provide a strong resource to fernley during this transition period and to work with fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible  .   another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with fernley and his business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000  .   i know that barry and richard sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all enron locations with trading operations  .   my earlier trips to london this year were focused solely on helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience  .   i value input from other trading operations professionals and i look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with barry, richard and some of their direct reports  .   i also contacted tani nath about my trip to see how i could support her as she moves into her role in global products  .   i have not heard from tani, but i understand from others that she will be in the houston office next week  .   it will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in houston and rick causey's desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to fernley, next week is the best for me to be in london  .   i did meet with tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over global products  .   i trust that she will contact me for that support as needed  .   i have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while i am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in london  .   i look forward to meeting with you next week  .   this trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are conducting at joe sutton's request  .   by circumstance, as you know, we have taken a look at helsinki and subsequently oslo and frankfurt  .   there will be a similar review of continental power, uk gas, uk power and global liquids  .   the review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of north american locations and some entities in the us in which enron has a large ownership position  .   it is likely that the continuation of this effort in london will occur in mid april  .   copies of the drafts of the findings for oslo and frankfurt were provided to fernley as soon as the team returned to houston  .   we hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from fernley and the business managers in oslo and frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided  .   fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies, so i will have those forwarded to you today  .   the sydney and singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip in london with regard to support for singapore  .   the houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with aa on an early draft last friday  .   i can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was pending input from bill bradford early this week (he made the trip but was out of the office last week)  .   we did do a preliminary review of the sydney and singapore findings with rick causey and rick buy on friday afternoon, to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week  .   they understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them  ."
conference call on wednesday morning,"i had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from harris county), and to my surprise i was selected to be a juror in a felony case  .   the case will continue on wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference call may not work  .   i will try to reach you from my car while i am on my way in for jury duty - probably around 8 30 or 9 00 houston time  ."
trip to london,"i didn't get a response from you regarding my e mail that i sent last week, but i have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to houston next week  .   my plans for being in london next week are firm, so it looks as if we will miss one another  .   my offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role, so i trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed  .   i will look forward to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide, with effective exception reporting  .   this is a key initiative for 2000 and will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities  ."
todd hall,"i got your voice mail message and i understand your concerns around todd's time  .   i think we have it backwards for james to dictate how and when todd's help would be needed  .   i think that we can review the to do list from james and get back with him on how much of that we can help with, who would do it, what the timing would be, how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing the work, etc  .   as i said originally, i knew that todd would not be interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work  .   todd's tendency (remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the work himself  .   he has had enough experience that his organization, guidance and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work himself  .   if james' list looks long and involved, how could todd lead these efforts, what kind of team might he ask james to provide, what additional short-term resources might we be able to tap into in houston, etc  .   we have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to james  .   if you are willing, i would be glad to explore this with todd and challenge him to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all of the work  .   i want him to think like a consultant on these projects, not as the contracted hired help  !   let me know what you think  .   --  a 08/17/2000 03 55 am"

confirms,"very belated reply - i am cleaning up old e mails today, and came across this one that i had not answered  .   commercial does not sign confirmations at this point  .   too many to make that practical these days  .   when i started the confirm desk in 1994, traders were signing at that time  .   once they knew that they had someone who would take responsibility to make sure they were right, they were very glad to pass that responsibility to me  .   in the early days of power, the traders once again were signing   .   obviously interested in the details of every deal that was done  .   but as the business grew, that too changed  .   --   enron communications 11/17/2000 07 53 pm"

meeting with mark frevert - should we move it up?,"not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than rick buy's vacation schedule  .   our meeting is set with mark frevert, rick buy, you and me on august 28 -- two weeks from next monday, dictated by rick buy's schedule  .   i am concerned that waiting that long to get with mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve  .   mike mcconnell and jeff shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the global markets team, which will include a discussion on brent's role and reporting responsibilities  .   brent and scott earnest are flying to london next monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses  .   many of their discussions will be with mike jordan and some logical points will be raised around co-ordination between eel and egm  .   in a conversation with gary hickerson on tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he wanted to be sure that i had responsibility over london operations, as he will have support personnel in london and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated  .   separately, jeff shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with brent in the operations/cao role but that he wanted brent to report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean  .   i told him that you and i had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for london and that we had a meeting planned with mark frevert on august 28  .   that's a lifetime to a trader, and jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month  .   what are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with mark frevert the summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week  .   i have checked mark's travel schedule  .   he will be in the houston office next week, with thursday, august 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting  .   i am not trying to rush this process, yet i know that by the end of august much will have been decided around coordinating between ena, egm and eel operations  .   i would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, rather than arrive at the party late  ."

steve susman,"the very first time that i laid eyes on , he was clad only in his underwear  .   moreover, he was shouting and angrily brandishing his fist at me  !   the northern lights may have seen stranger sights, but i assure you i have not  .   in 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that i have repressed the actual date), i journeyed to fort worth, texas as a representative of the texas law review to attend some state bar of texas committee meeting, one being held, i think, in conjunction with an annual meeting of the bar  .   the law review had reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels  .   i arrived late at night, dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room key, took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the room key, and opened the door  .   the darkness that shrouded the room was suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why i had violated the sanctity of his room  !   it will surprise none who know steve to learn that although he was adamantly insisting on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough for me to offer him one  .   knowing even at my then tender young age a madman when i see one, i exited the scene of the controversy with as much speed as my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury  .   there may well have been some talk of calling hotel security or the fort worth police, but in the end i settled for a new room, the door of which i bolted immediately  .   after a mostly sleepless night during which i anticipated the imminent reappearance of the madman, i arose, showered, dressed, and carefully made my way to the meeting room  .   during the course of the day, i spotted the madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual  .   surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, i asked if he knew him  .   the answer was no, but he did know who he was  .   the name is susman, my man,   .   i immediately resolved that my path and that of susman, my man, would never again cross  .   truth is indeed stranger than fiction  .   how could i have possibly foreseen as i fled from the madman in that forth worth hotel room so many years ago that not only would my path again cross his but that i would one day serve as his lawyer, that he would serve as mine, and that i would count him as one of my closest friends  !   i hereby officially forgive you, steve, not only for stealing my fort worth hotel room but also for the injury you wished on me that night  .   looking back on it, i wouldn't want it to have been any other way  .   i wish you the happiest of birthdays, steve  ."

emazing positive living tip of the day - your environment,"positive living tip of the day monday january 29, 2001 your environment do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life if so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life  .   hostile environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude  .   for example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects everyone in the office  .   and hanging around negative friends and family members can reinforce your own negative traits  .   (for example, your temper is under control as long as you are not around your older brother  .  ) in addition, negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes and behaviors that they possess  .   it is true the company you keep is a reflection on you and can influence your behavior  .   steer clear of negative environments and begin building a positive life  .   - cg, licensed clinical professional counselor"

meeting with tana,"and  tana came into my office la night and seemed to be very upset about how the other 2 legal assiants were treating her, especially susan bailey, and also about the fact taht susan bailey was going to be part of samantha's training and that this was a surprise to her  .   on the latter issue, i explained to her that given that the 2 susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of samantha's training especially since tana was now out of the day to day uff  .   i am very concerned that tana is going to interfere with susan's training process given her attitude toward the whole thing which i really feel is ridiculous  .   the only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's tana's way of not be able to let go and not being a team player  .   i explained to her that both she and tana had different roles to play with respect to samantha's training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, susan was more than qualified to handle this part of samantha's training  .  on the fir point, i told tana that the only way that this group is gong to work better is through communicating to each other  .   i firmly believe taht there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way  .   tana of course will not admit this  .   i have no answers for this issue other than the fact that i am tired of hearing about why they can't get along  .   i also told tana taht it was my perception that susan bailey has been under alot of pressure given her increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude which even i have noticed has been a little different lately  .  i'm letting the both of you know about this because i don't want any of this to negatively impact samantha to the extent that it can be avoided  ."

my jeep,"i went to kelly blue book on the internet and they provide 2 values for used vehicles, a trade in value (what you might expect to get for a vehicle from a dealer on trade in) and a retail value (what you might expect to pay for a vehicle from a dealer)  .   the following were the values it came up with for a jeep exactly like mine in montana (closest state)  .  trade in - $15330 usd ($22750 cnd)retail - $20945 usd ($31061 cnd)the retail number seems way too high  .   i think something like $23 000 to $25000 would be fair  .  let me know what you think  ."

ontario master project,", just a follow-up to your email  .   i would agree that opg is mistaken  .   after the meeting, chris and i and others started the process of explaining to joel sheinfied, a contract administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered power  .   on this issue i think it would be helpful to present opg w/ a product definition that works with the physical master  .   i know chris is already working on this  .   from what it sounds like, the ontario pool is not that different from nepool  .   in ui, chris worked on a product definition that you could incorporate into the physical master  .   i also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single mw flowing)  .   this is what we did in ui  .   this is what we do in the california pool  .   this is what we attempt to do in nepool  .   i think the eei fm gets you to the same place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree that the language could be more direct  .   with the california product (caiso energy) we expressly modify the eei fm since there are so many other things we also have to fix  .   we likely in the future will also modify fm for the nepool product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in the us that this is a change for the near future  .   in general, fm is unique to the product and i believe will change with each product  .   when chris and i were talking to opg we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the"

eei draft- historical data for future use in the battle of the,"confirmation processa huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in the eei contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains substantive terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the deemed accepted language  .   i have been very vocal against adding this language  .   the politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much of successful politics, dirty  .   i'm not sure where this will end up, but feel like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as enron's position (confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless objected to in a timely manner)  .   i will keep everybody posted on the results of the vote  ."
index transactions,"epmi is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating, published index price  .   our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed  .   under isda for financial trading, this is addressed as a market disruption event (mde)  .   under ena's standard contract for financial trading, there is included as a mde the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate   .   what this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be required (under isda) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap  .  i want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a mde  .   if you treat the imposition of a cap (say in ca of prices to $500 or in nepool to $1,000) as a mde, then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each e that a pricing date trades at the cap level  .   this only seems fraught with litigation risk to me  .   alternatively, if caps are not deemed a mde, then you would always settle against the published prices, even if they are artificially determined after the trade was entered into  .   while caps are not appealing, i think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a mde  .   i have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this  .   so, depending upon what you both think, we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue  ."
pca arbitration provision,"in general, enron would prefer all matters with respect to power go to arbitration for all issues  .   when we first started trading power we limited arbitration because we were uncertain where/how the market was going  .   accordingly, we limited arbitration to financial matters only  .   i only raised the issue last week because the scope of arbitration came up in another case and we were uncertain whether an issue of proper termination would be subject to the arbitration provision or not  .   in conclusion, based on today's policies (arbitrate everything), i would not think that there would be any reason for us to be concerned with preserving an argument of limited applicability of the arbitration language found in the pca master  .  i briefly reviewed your draft answer and will fax the comments to you shortly  ."

attorney work product,"&  attached is a draft of the memo we spoke about the other day  .   we tried to come up with as many arguments as possible, recognizing the strong commercial desire to put in the second interconnect  .   as we have discussed, certain language in the interconnect agreement is troublesome, generally due to the fact that it does not appear that a second interconnect was contemplated at the time the project was initially developed  .   nonetheless, we believe that caledonia does have a number of arguments in favor of the position that it should be able to build the second interconnect without a contractual block  .   the strength of some of these arguments will turn in large part on further factual development with the commercial group, as noted in a number of places in the memo  .  please let me know when you wish to follow up  .   and, as i noted in my conversation with  this morning, there is a possibility i may be in houston next week and perhaps we could meet with the commercial folks at that time  .   i think it would be advisable to walk through the various possible scenarios/strategies with them so that we have the benefit of the tva history and likely responses of tva to some of the arguments noted in the memo  ."

30,"dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an into product is and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission  .   attendees from dynegy will include griff jones (dynegy's head of trading), matt (whose last name i didn't get) and their lawyer harlan murphy  .   if you think somebody else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and i can talk to harlan  .   assuming the meeting stays scheduled, i will schedule an internal meeting to briefly go over the eei into definition before we meet with dynegy  .  as you are aware, in connection with the eei effort we worked extensively with a large group of industry participants to define what an into product is  .   dynegy and peco were the two companies that were very outspoken against they way the product ultimately got defined  .   dynegy put on a big dog and pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that eei's into product was flawed  .   their position, while not completely expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an into product and are making deliveries on firm transmission, then the seller will always be excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in general, this is contrary to eei which obligates the seller to go to another interface unless the cut was due to buyer's use of non firm transmission when firm was available or due to buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the receiving control area)  .   dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go physical  .   at the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent product  .   dynegy's concept was rejected at the eei meetings  .  i hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals   .   get dynegy to agree to trade into with us under a common into definition - dynegy will not sign an eei with us because of the into definition  .   we trade into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common understanding of what we are trading  .   critical to clear up this ambiguity  .   secure dynegy as an advocate of eei - because dynegy was so vocal against eei's into definition, if they now started using eei, it would further boost acceptance of the contract and isolate peco as the only other major voice against the into definition  .   reexamine the into product as it is currently drafted and consider what will happen as access to transmission changes - because the into product is such an important part of east trading today, it is critical that internally we all agree how it should operate  .   additionally, it is critical that we start thinking about how the into product will be affected by changes in transmission, such as the advent of rtos (with long term into deals we may want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes into an rto)call me with any questions/thoughts  ."

self provision for a/s,"jeff, here is a first cut of some of the questions that need to be answered by the generator that is offering this service  .   i will have more as i dig into the detail this week  .   1) non performance by counterparty (don't deliver energy when called) - who is going to be held financially responsible if the generator is unable to meet the iso instructions to inc or dec gen 2) is the generator located in the grid or out of the grid - this is important to know so that we can evaluate our control area risk  .   3) has the generator registered and been certified by the iso to deliver all of the a/s products(regulation,spin, non-spin and replacement) - need to know the specific unit id's of the performing units so that we can verify w/ the iso  .   4) are we paying the generator based on what we bid in to the iso or on what the iso actually grants to epmi  .   5) are we paying the generator a fixed price on capacity and energy or just passing through what the iso pays epmi minus losses for energy  .   other risks that we need to take look at as epmi 1) will the revenue stream coming in from the a/s payments put epmi at risk of becoming a creditor to the iso instead of a debtor  .   2) epmi reputation w/ the iso if the generator has perpetual non-performance issues  .   this could impact all of our a/s business if the iso feels that epmi is not able to meet its a/s obligation to the iso on a consistent basis  .   3) need to make sure that they have language in the contract that covers epmi and ees if we loss a dispute to the iso  .   4) risk to epmi if the generator fails to deliver energy and the iso takes back all capacity payment back to the last time in which epmi performed on an energy call  .   i think this is based on the entire epmi portfolio not just for a specific unit  .   i will need to check on this item monday  ."

phillip,"not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed like nobody was really that interested in doing it  .   we think it's dangerous to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend  .   we definitely want to do something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the birthdays simple  ."
2 new products,"the 2 products will be epng socal ehrenberg and pg&e topock  .   the reason why we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit el paso merchant energy from trading them  .   the reason why we want to do this is that el paso merchant energy is refusing to trade with us, the western region, both on their online trading system, ice, and also in the broker market  .   we feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing field level  .   i'm sure this will bring up some questions, which should be directed to our vp, mike grigsby, if further explanation is needed  .   again, the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way, and they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on eol by 2/28 at the latest  ."
warning mildly offensive but funny as hell,"thirsty cowboys two cowboys from texas walk into a roadhouse to wash the trail dust from their throats  .   they stand at the bar, drinking their beers and talking quietly about cattle prices  .  suddenly a woman at a table behind them, who had been eating a sandwich, begins to cough  .   after a minute or so it becomes apparent that she is in real distress, and the cowboys turn to look at her  .  kin ya swaller asks one of the cowboys  .  no, the woman shakes her head  .  kin ya breathe asks the other  .  the woman, beginning to turn a bit blue, shakes her head no again  .   the first cowboy walks over to her, lifts up the back of her skirt, yanks down her panties, and slowly runs his tongue from the back of her thigh up to the small of her back  .  this shocks the woman to a violent spasm, the obstruction flies out of her mouth, and she begins to breathe again  .  the cowboy walks back over to the bar and takes a drink of his beer  .   his partner says, ya know, i'd heard of that there hind lick maneuver, but, i never seen anybody do it  ."

customer service complaint,"hello , my name is   (one pass bj927934)  .   my husband, patrick( one pass vf751282), and i have been one pass members for a few years now as well as elite members on several occasions  .   we also use chase continental visa exclusively, and my husband is a president's club member  .   i have made continental my airline of choice for as long as i can remember booking my own travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied mer in the past  .   this morning, however, i had a very bad experience  .   i booked tickets for a vacation back on september 4th for a trip from houston to new york on december 1  .   since i booked the ticket, i became pregnant and found out from my doctor last week that i will still be unable to travel on december 1st due to complications with my pregnancy  .   my doctor indicated to me that i may not be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in june  .   i spoke to leroy peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on september 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time i book a ticket for me or my husband  .   i understand that this is the same policy that you would have given me if i had just decided that i didn't feel like taking a vacation this weekend  .   in my opinion, this is an unacceptable policy in the event of medical complications  .   as you can see with my situation, it is unlikely that my husband and i will be able to plan a vacation by september of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month old child  .   i repeatedly asked leroy if there was anyone else who could help me or anyone i could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your policy  .   i indicated that i could provide a doctor's note if necessary  .   he was very rude to me, stating you don't have to ask me 7 different times for the same thing - i already told you no  !   i had to cancel a flight for work about a month ago on southwest airlines for the same reason, but i was hoping that i would be able to fly again by now  .   for your information, your competitor was very helpful  .   they accepted my doctor's note, gave me a credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another person's name if i am still unable to use it  .   that ticket was also booked as a non-refundable fare  .   although i have always used continental for my personal travel, the treatment i have had in this difficult time has definitely made me second-guess my future choices  .   if there is anything you can do to help, i would greatly appreciate it  ."

"redrock permit issue, requested information",", presented below is the first memo i sent out concering the air permit issue yesterday evening i phoned both the state of arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and region 9 epa ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the redrock expansion  .   i was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance  .   they cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons  .   i am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in march of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting  .  i have a call into the state of arizona ( construction is to begin at station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate some construction activities such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit  .   i have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive  .   if this flys i am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued  .   i know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays  .   ill keep you apprised of this issue  .   i spoke with the adeq after our conference call and they directed me to another group (compliance) in the air permit section  .   they strongly suggested that i contact the compliance group before contacting nancy wrona, director of the adeq  .   i left a message with the supervisor of the adeq compliance section, kathy mcconnell ( ) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back from her  .   either bill  or i will be touching base with her again, tomorrow  .   has given me the following list of construction items he would like to have the adeq grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air permits all earthwork trench construction and piping tie ins all foundation and building construction installation of ancillary equipmentthis list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may allow us to do  ."
additonal pcb sampling on the socal system,"during the quarterly conference call with socal in which we discuss pcb costs on the socal system, for which transwesten is 86% responsible, ralph komai, socal's pcb person provded some addtional information with respect to what is going on with the pcb activities on the socal system  .   as a result of the pg&e press release, socal management directed additional sampling to be done at their interconnect with transwestern and downstream of this interconnect  .   ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, however one sample at their kelso station, near barstow, came back at 77 ppm  .   ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the pcb's coming into their collection locations in the needles area as evidenced by the following based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered data collected in 1998 showed that approx  .   8% of the liquids were greater than 50 ppm data collected in 1999 showed that approx  .   9% of the liquids were greater than 50 ppmbased upon this, ralph had stated that socal would be collecting additional sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring program, somewhat like pg&e is currently doing now  .  i had informed ralph that our needles m/s facility had seen almost no liquids in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been collected  .   we discussed that the accumulations seen on the socal system were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased flows from tw into socal  .   ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions resulting from the recent hits   .   he just indicated that they would be watching their system and sampling at a more frequent basis  ."

adeq requirement for notification of mechanical activities,"i received a call from a permit engineer with the arizona dept  .   of environmental quality (adeq) concerning the issue of notification of mechanical activities at c/s 2 flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period for agency review and approval  .   due to the urgency of the c/s 2 work being performed, i had written a notification to the agency friday evening requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work which was included with the letter  .   on monday, the engineer called and said that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding at the c/s  .   after we had discussed this issue at some length, i posed the question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of mechanical and maintenace activities which will not impact or change a combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a change in design  .   after some discussions i informed him that transwestern will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will rest on transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in arizona without any notification to the agency  .   the only hitch being, that when transwestern does a major mechanical activity, which would cost more than 25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, that we provide them a courtesy notification  .   i told them we would apprise them of such an activity  ."

socal meeting with southwest gas,"i wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between southwest gas and socal concerning presence of pcbs on the southwest gas system will be this tuesday  .   i had an opportunity to speak with ralph komai today during the pcb quarterly management conference call that transwestern has with socal to discuss pcb related invoices  .   as a brief summary, southwest has had isolated hits of pcb in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe) in regulators on their system and they have asked ralph if he would assist them in the management and disposal of pcbs on their system  .   he wil also be providing thoughts on how and why pcbs move in a gas pipeline  .  i had asked ralph not to mention about transwestern's agreement with socal for which transwestern pays socal for 86% of their pcb costs  .   i had asked him to only focus on the southwest system  .   apparently southwest is not up to speed with the pcb regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that the mega rule will impact their operations and ralph will probably provide input for that as well from an ldc standpoint  .   i asked ralph whether southwest seemed excited or worried about the pcb discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned about compliance with the pcb regulations  .   ralph said he will let me know the results of the meeting  ."

"fuel consumption, la plata a","guys, i received harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements  .   my question is, how does the fuel use compare with what solar says the fuel use should be if we can get solar to provide written guarantees and up the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the fuel value on the permit  .   the state of colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment  .   from their eyes, this would be a strong indication of excess emissions, and i think there evaluation would hold some merit  .   anyway, i dont want to send up a red flag to the state of colorado  .   would you contact solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at la plata then let me know  .   if worse gets to worse, i may be able to use another tactic, but only as a last resort  ."
phone conversation with tnc,"today i spoke with jean calhoun of the arizona chapter of the nature conservancy about the proposed sundevil pipeline construction project  .   she was very cordial and appreciative concerning transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project  .   although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of flagstaff into roughly northern phoenix  .   the area south of flagstaff into phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the tnc with major biological diversity of plants and animals  .   the tnc has completed published studies on two of the regions  .   the tnc has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by ferc  .   to the south and east of flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the verde river which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the river  .   this river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across arizona  .   i have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the tnc, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route  .   part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of arizona  .   i think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known  ."

"compliance order, p-1 c/s","transwestern received a compliance order from the state of new mexico, air quality bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the p-1 c/s which occurred in 1996  .   transwestern had met with the aqb over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further actions were received from the agency until this compliance order was received  .   the issue in question was transwestern's replacement of interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing smaller turbine (3505)  .   the larger internal components (inlet guide vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine  .   when transwestern received permit approval from the aqb to operate at the larger turbine capacity, transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher turbine value 4700  .   the aqb did not understand that transwestern could not make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by transwestern would void the warranty with soalr mfg  .   only solar is authorized to make adjustments to the turbine  .   this prevents transwestern from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this turbine at their descretion  .  in the 1996 meeting with the aqb, transwestern committed to conducting a emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than the permitted values for the 3505  .   it was shown that emissions from the 4700 were less than that permitted by the aqb for the 3505  .   it should also be mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple cycle  .   apparently, epa has mandated that the aqb act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the epa  .   dave nutt has been sent the compliance order to review  .   under the conditions of the order, transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing  .   id like to have a group discussion to decide how transwestern will manage and handle this issue  .   would someone contact anabelle and have her set up a conference call for sometime next week"
