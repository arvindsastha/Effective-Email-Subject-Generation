long descriptions - indexes,"dave one item that was left open after my meeting with  d  .   this morning was what the index should look like and how much input we have had from the confirm desk  .   my inclination was that the index should be the same language that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the gtc taken together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous contract  .    felt that the index should provide a more complete description than the short description abbreviation but that the full  text could wait for the paper confirm  .  given 's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine as far as they go and has not attempted to corr them with the full  language  .   said he would be contacting you himself but i thought it might make sense to give you my version as well  .  what are your thoughts if you'd like to discuss, i will be in by 9 00 tomorrow but have a meeting at 10 and then the meeting with all of the lawyers and  to discuss the further long description review at 11  ."

travel service forum - question,"i won't be able to attend the forum since i am travelling but do have a suggestion that would make tap a bit more attractive  .   when a traveller is placed on a wait list the agency should check back with the provider regularly and often to see if the wait can be cleared  .   if you wait for the provider to get back to you, as appears to be tap's policy, the chances are significantly reduced since the provider will almost invariably clear the person on the phone before anyone on the list  .   other agents have done this for me, i have done this for myself, and it works  ."

legal agreement,my analysis is that forcing the scroll through the entire agreement provides additional comfort that the counterparty has actually looked at the agreement and knows to what they are agreeing - it is that much more likely that the contract will be enforceable  .   it is certainly not necessary from my point of view that the document take up the entire page rather than appearing in a smaller window with a scroll bar down the side - in fact i think that looks much better  .   it would be acceptable from a  point of view if the agree button appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work until the agreement had been scrolled through  .   i personally think that would create more problems from a commercial point of view since many counterparties will try to click on agree as soon as it appears without reading the agreement and get frustrated when it doesn't work right away  .   david - do you agree  09/28/99 03 55 pm

synthetic storage,",i'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging  .   each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market  .   then that day's transactions can be entered to calculate the p & l of transactions which close out previous positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions  .   initially, i thought that daily p&l could be calculated by simply adjusting the p&l whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time value and storage costs would be included)  .   however, this only works if the person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking  .   as the seller of utilizing 100% hedging, i should be able to do this, except for the fact that i will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there  .   the main question i have is simply, should i be calculating the p&l for each person's storage book for open and closed positions then beyond that, if we do calculate the p&l's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage is not hedged, i will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it  .   so, i guess i could apply the model for that purpose  .   does this make sense to you any comments are appreciated  ."
hola,"steve,i'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - definitely restricts the possibilities  .   what are the chances of a follow-on tour won't the contract be renewed if your tour was indeed over, would how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company  .   the later the better for me, but seriously, i could probably get on plane next weekend if that was the only opportunity  .   i'll give a call sometime, but i don't think i have the number anywhere  .   can you send it to me fyi, my numbers"

cuiaba epc/changeorders - please respond,i like this conceptually as an approach to manage costs but see the potential plems with shell if eecc is paid on time  .   i think it may also be extremely difficult to rework the ld's because the eecc wrap does not match up with the subs very well (in some cases eecc's protection exceeds the subs and in other is less)  .   i also wonder who is the credit for contractor obligations in this scenario for the lenders  e 01/20/2001 09 31 am
dresdner kleinwort benson potential conflict of interest,graham just called back and said that the rio m&a people were engaged by petras to review other enron asset sales ( i think this implies elektro and the ldc's) and it was only recently that we requested that petras consider cuiaba as well  .   in any case he assured me that there is a strong chinese wall between the project finance group and the m&a group so it is unlikely that they could obtain any info as a result  .   he assured me that they will make everyone aware of the need for increased care on cuiaba information handling due to this situation  .   let me know if you require more  .   it is my understanding that neal provided similar reasuarance at your meeting today  .

interconnection agreements,", i think the supplemental info you have provided is outstanding and helpful to the lenders in understanding the overall picture and the history  .   however, its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as i understand it  .   the lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically about third party liability meaning, i believe, lawsuits or claims from parties who did not receive power because cuiaba failed to generate  .   therefore, i think the questions which tozzinni needs to address are along the lines of   .   if epe is required to sign the agreements by aneel, what is the extent of damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements   .   could any consequential damages be assessed   .   could epe excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid documents, the ppa or other agreements with furnas, electronote or eletrabras   .   how would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement which was payable by epe could the process be expedited to avert a liquidity crisis   .   could epe be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a spot market price assessed by the mae stemming from an unscheduled outage   .   similarly, could epe incur penalties or be denied transmission if they failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of the agreements   .   will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons (such as access to back-up power) which would be excluded from the protections by furnas under the ppa   .   could furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability 10) a question for insurance - does our business interuption insurance"

hiring practices for summer interns,"while recruiting on campus recently i became aware that a decision was made at the program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns  .   in talking with students and faculty at the university of texas and university of oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 2001 interns  .   i have communicated my concerns to lexi elliott and her manager, shelley jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a program level based on enron's staffing  .   when i asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, i was even more concerned to discover that neither lexi nor shelley had that data  .   it would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our analyst and associates programs  .   i have had conversations over the last two weeks with lexi and shelley, with no resolution  .   when they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns, i volunteered to have james scribner, a senior director on my team, obtain this market information  .   lexi and shelley either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do so  .   they were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information  .   i now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at ut and ou this fall for summer intern positions  .   and based on this information, i believe that enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall  .   while my research only touches on two of the schools at which enron recruits, i want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting  .   as administrators of the program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the enron message to campus  .   i believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two-way messaging system  .   i strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days  .   i suspect that many enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships  .   in working with rick causey and mike mcconnell, executive sponsors for ut and ou, respectively, they are as concerned as i about the decision on interviewing summer interns  .   i have copied both of them on this note to the two of you  .   please let me know how this can be resolved  .   with the help of james scribner and others, we have already compiled a list of students at ut and ou that should be targeted for summer internships  .   i will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the program to devise creative ways to turn this around  ."

meeting with mark frevert - should we move it up?,"not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than rick buy's vacation schedule  .   our meeting is set with mark frevert, rick buy, you and me on august 28 -- two weeks from next monday, dictated by rick buy's schedule  .   i am concerned that waiting that long to get with mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve  .   mike mcconnell and jeff shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the global markets team, which will include a discussion on brent's role and reporting responsibilities  .   brent and scott earnest are flying to london next monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses  .   many of their discussions will be with mike jordan and some logical points will be raised around co-ordination between eel and egm  .   in a conversation with gary hickerson on tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he wanted to be sure that i had responsibility over london operations, as he will have support personnel in london and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated  .   separately, jeff shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with brent in the operations/cao role but that he wanted brent to report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean  .   i told him that you and i had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for london and that we had a meeting planned with mark frevert on august 28  .   that's a lifetime to a trader, and jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month  .   what are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with mark frevert the summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week  .   i have checked mark's travel schedule  .   he will be in the houston office next week, with thursday, august 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting  .   i am not trying to rush this process, yet i know that by the end of august much will have been decided around coordinating between ena, egm and eel operations  .   i would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, rather than arrive at the party late  ."

trip to london next week,"brent price and i will be in the london office next week, arriving monday morning and returning to houston on friday  .   the purpose of my visit is in regard to my global risk management operations role, i believe that rick causey met with you regarding some operations support that brent and i will provide to fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of michael jordan, the jp morgan staffer that fernley has hired  .   brent and i will be working with fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for fernley during that transition period  .   we will also map out an enron trading operations introduction for michael jordan, which may involve a short stint for him in houston  .   my goal is to provide a strong resource to fernley during this transition period and to work with fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible  .   another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with fernley and his business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000  .   i know that barry and richard sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all enron locations with trading operations  .   my earlier trips to london this year were focused solely on helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience  .   i value input from other trading operations professionals and i look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with barry, richard and some of their direct reports  .   i also contacted tani nath about my trip to see how i could support her as she moves into her role in global products  .   i have not heard from tani, but i understand from others that she will be in the houston office next week  .   it will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in houston and rick causey's desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to fernley, next week is the best for me to be in london  .   i did meet with tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over global products  .   i trust that she will contact me for that support as needed  .   i have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while i am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in london  .   i look forward to meeting with you next week  .   this trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are conducting at joe sutton's request  .   by circumstance, as you know, we have taken a look at helsinki and subsequently oslo and frankfurt  .   there will be a similar review of continental power, uk gas, uk power and global liquids  .   the review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of north american locations and some entities in the us in which enron has a large ownership position  .   it is likely that the continuation of this effort in london will occur in mid april  .   copies of the drafts of the findings for oslo and frankfurt were provided to fernley as soon as the team returned to houston  .   we hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from fernley and the business managers in oslo and frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided  .   fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies, so i will have those forwarded to you today  .   the sydney and singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip in london with regard to support for singapore  .   the houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with aa on an early draft last friday  .   i can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was pending input from bill bradford early this week (he made the trip but was out of the office last week)  .   we did do a preliminary review of the sydney and singapore findings with rick causey and rick buy on friday afternoon, to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week  .   they understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them  ."

recommendation for analyst rotation - jody crook,"along with mike mcconnell, i am active in recruiting for enron's analyst program at the university of oklahoma  .   we became involved in recruiting there two years ago when i learned about a targeted undergraduate program that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program  .   ou transformed their old plm (petroleum land management) program into the energy management program in the school of business  .   this undergraduate degree retains the geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the plm program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a trading floor course  .   with the added plus of many of these students growing up in or around energy families in oklahoma or texas, i thought that recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to enron  .   our recruiting efforts at ou continue to be successful and our ou energy management graduates have done well at enron  .   our first hire from ou (and the top energy management student) was jody crook  .   he joined the analyst program last february after a december 1999 graduation  .   his first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book administrator in gas trading  .   he is in the process of looking for a second rotation at the end of february, and i think that he is someone that you should consider for a rotation on your team  .   in addition to this last year's risk experience at enron, jody worked as a landman for two summers for burlington resources  .   i was very involved in recruiting jody to enron  .   i think very highly of him, and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the analyst program  .   his background and your business seem to be a good fit  .   please visit with jody as he contacts your group about a rotation  .   it will be well worth your time  ."
