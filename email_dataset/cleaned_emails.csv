if you have any questions please contact  walsh at 713 8539510. bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8th deadline due to lack of supportsources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may 8th deadline.  any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  according to sources both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis.  the democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis.  many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund.  clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place.  additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 2001.  if not the state may be in breach of contract.  sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult. the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion.  however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession.  sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab 8x and ab 31x.  ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to 10 billion in bonds.  this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support.  ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab 8x.  senator bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund.  for instance tony strickland has stated that only 1 2 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion should be issued.  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds.  the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday.  additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan.  key points of the bridge financing. ,11,21,california update 5/4/01

jaques after meeting with george and larry it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit.  their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials.  then there is a layer of construction management fees of .  there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money.  but i thin the majority of it is profit.  finally the builders profit of 1. 4 million. eith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  after all if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors we were definitely not intending to insert an additional fee in addition to the superintendent costs.  george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using.  i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don t thin the construction management fee is included. george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  i will review and let you now what i thin. the gp issues don t seem to be a point of contention.  they are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. let me now if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for only true costs 1. 4 million. ,13,-1,general issues

structure typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or llc general partner.  the general partner owns of the project and carries theliability of construction. land ownership loansthe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  each of the individual investors andall of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  if the investor s do not sign on the loans this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profitsis reduced. all loans for residential construction that are intended for resale arefull recourse loans.  if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benonrecourse. use of initial investmentthe initial investment is used for land deposit engineering architectural design soils tests surveys filing fees legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation and appraisals.  unlikemany real estate investment programs none of the funds are used for fees tocreekside builders llc.  these professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period. early land coststhe 4 000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  as an alternative we can close into a land loan atprobably of appraised value.  with a land value equal to the purchaseprice of 680 000 this would mean a land loan of 476 000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of 3 966 given a annual interest rate plusapproximately 1.  of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. equity at improvement loanonce the site plan is approved by the city of austin the city will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements referred to asthe fiscals.  this cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by coa.  this release will befor of the cost with the remaining released one year aftercompletion.  releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  these fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  as such they have to be counted as adevelopment cost even though they are not spent.  because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds. the lot improvement loan is typically of the appraised value of afinished lot which i suspect will be at least 20 000 and potentially ashigh as 25 000.  this would produce a loan amount of 15 000 on 20 000per lot.  with estimated per lot improvement costs of 9 000 fiscals at 2 000 and the land cost at 8 000 total improved lot cost is 19 000which means 0 to 4 000 per lot in total equity.  the investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  thus the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be 0 184 000.  even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent.  the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  the engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement. phasing works as follows.  if the first phase was say 40 units the totallot improvement cost might average 31 000 per lot.  of this probably 13 000 would be for improvements and 19 000 for the land cost.  theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts the entry road water treatment costs perimeter fencing andlandscaping and so on as well as for of the land.  the land loan forundeveloped lots would be of the appraised raw lot value which i wouldestimate as 10 000 per lot for a loan value of 7 000 per lot.  then theloan value for each improved lot would be 15 000 per lot.  this would giveyou a total loan of 992 000 total cost of 1 232 645 for equity requiredof 241 000.  this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint. construction loansthere are three types of construction loans.  first is a speculative spec loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity.  second isa construction loan for a presold unit but the loan remains in thebuilder developers name.  third is a presold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  we expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loansin the name of the builder developer.  we do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. spec loans will be for to of value and construction loans forpresold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender willbe from to of value. disbursementsdisbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current andnear term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  the general partnerwill contract with creekside builders llc to construct the units and thefee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs. these fees are the only monies to creekside larry lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit except for a direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  for example if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub orcannot find enough trim carpenters etc.  and it decides to undertake thisfunction it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. finally cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  at present cb does not ownany significant equipment but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing cornice roofing and drywall spreading. reportingwe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs.  plan. what did you have in mind i would like to use

jeff before you write off a few things to thin about.  operating expenses include 22 000 of materials for maintenance and repairs.  plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs.  there are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.  what is an outside management firm going to do a full time onsite manager is all that is required.  as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning.  another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more mae readies and lawn care.  if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.  considering 1 2 115 000 noi is not necessarily overstated.  if you want to be ultra conservative use 100 000 at the lowest.  getting cash out is not a priority to me.  so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash.  a note actually attractive.  see below. my job just doesn t give me the time to manage this property.  this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. sales price 705 0001st lien 473 5002nd lien 225 000transfer fee 7 500cash required 14 500noi 100 0001st lien 47 2922nd lien 23 694cash flow 29 014cash on cash these numbers are using the conservative noi if it comes in at 115 then cash on cash return would be more lie .  this doesn t reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price. do you want to reconsider let me now. ,0,-1,the stage

liane as we discussed yesterday i am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the el paso san juan monthly index.  a single buyer entered the maretplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above maret prices 4. 80 for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  at the time of these trades offers for physical gas at significantly 10 to 15 cents lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  additionally these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan.  we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27.  these are the complete list of trades from enron online eol enron s direct phone conversations and three broerage firms amerex apb and prebon .  please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships.  the two ey points from this data are as follows 1.  the high physical prices on the 26th 27th 4. 75 4 80 are much greater than the high financial trades 4. 665 on those days.  the spread relationship between san juan and other points socal northwest is consistent between the end of september and october gas daily.  it doesn t mae sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different.  i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  hopefully the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4. 70 s and these trades are outliers.  i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  it is enron s belief that the trades at 4. 70 and higher were above maret trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index.  it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal. sincerely. ,0,2,san juan index

enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austinthat we told you about.  as you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over per year over 3 years. this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asaustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the austin market. the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  asit is in the smart growth corridor area designated by the city of austinfor preferred development this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  additionally many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  i have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in northaustin which included a detention retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention retention and filtration pondrequirement i used this data to be cautious.  the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at st.  edwards university. as with most infill projects the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  we have included a fence around the entire property but mayonly put it on westgate and cameron loop.  gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences. the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of 680 000 andan extended escrow.  this will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract which will mean that we can close intoan a d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. this analysis shows your investment at 700 000 for a interest in theprofits of the project.  as we discussed in san marcos we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  i believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  you would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  larry lewter knows an expert in the field in sanantonio if you do not know anyone. i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker by airborne express today for saturday delivery. once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either5123381119 or 5123381110.  my cell phone is 5127487495 and the fax is5123381103.  i look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner. i regret that it took so long to get back to you but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  a small freakish wind storm with severe 60 mpgdowndrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes. one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  the city shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  then last week i had to takemy wife to emergency.  she has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week.  there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.  fortunately it looks asif she will be ok in the long run. george w.  richardscreekside builders llc. ,0,1,westgate proformaphillip allen.xls

i was aware that regan lehman the lot developer for the entire 70 lotduplex project was selling his units in the 180 s he does have a muchlower basis in the lots than anyone else but the prime differences are dueto a he is selling them during construction and b they are smaller units. we do not know the exact size of each of his units but we believe one ofthe duplexes is a 1164 1302 sq ft.  plan.  this would produce an average sqfootage of 1233 which would be 73. 80 psf at 182 000.  i thought hissales price was 187 000.  at this price psf our 1 376 sf unit would sellfor 203 108. what is more important in my view is a the rental rate and b therentability.  you have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  as for rentability i believe that we have shown that the3bedroom 3. 5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.  in fact if wewere able to purchase additional lots from regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3bedroom plan. phillip i will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.  richardscreekside builders llc. ,0,-1,sagewood town homes
it s funny the spreads in gas.  first in gas you can play the seasonality game.  does anybody want to buy m n at 1 back.  no of course not.  but in crude m n at . 10 back is normal.  definitely a game as you try to keep month on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.  that s why cal 2 is as high as it is.  when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt month.  i can t remember w o looking at charts.  it s always the mentality. ,0,-1,mkts

a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to switching and slowdown in economy.  big 3 automakers all temporarily closing plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at 1. some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test of the next 3 5 days.  will the switching loss of demand storage management keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to 5 .  not too many years ago we had a 50 print on the hub.  unless we get some crazy prints you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.  funny watching the flies in the front.  bot large chunk of g h j at . 50 friday morning.  probably worth 1. 30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g h.  what s the thoughts on distillates.  is it tight enough such that gas switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market too oversupplied to care. ,0,-1,summer inverses

good question.  the exchange nymex and i enron online offer a nearly identical product.  the fight is over which execution model is superior.  i would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  it s happened in europe already.  the largest commodity exchange in europe the liffe went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  within weeks the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  i still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  the exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  it is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.     ryan . r.  vanderbilt. edu on 10 03 2000 01 23 01 pm. ,11,-1,thank you for dinner last night

the problem if we limit the size on to being what size is offered on the swap hedge we will not be able to offer adequate size on the .  optimally i think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes.  if the swap is 4 4. 5 one a day up and someone buys half a day making the market 4 4. 5 one a day by half a day the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts a much smaller size than most people want to trade.  if we restrict to strikes with a lower delta we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in that have open eol interest that have moved closer to the money.  maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the eol swap mid market.  thus if the front swap on eol is 4 4. 5 one a day by half a day the input into the option calculator is . 75 100 up.  in this case i think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest we must continue to support it.  thus i anticipate having to make markets in deep itm as the market moves. in terms of straddle strikes i think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the eol offer and vice versa is not big enough to compensate for what i think the industry will view as a scam and another way enron is trying to rip people off.  although striking on the mid market is probably easier for the trader i actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense.  it allows people to trade out of the position on eol.  whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200 they have to call ene to close the trade.  if the trade is struck at 3100 we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  secondly i would anticipate non volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction. ,8,17,options
just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  first what happens if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on eol second what strike are straddles traded at.  are they set at the nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid market of the eol quote. ,1,-1,options

i am changing the way the curve is generated starting in jan 2004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals.  there are convincing arguments as to why the summer winter spreads should tighten over time.  however in the previous methodology they blew out.  for instance summer winter in cal 3 was . 232 while cal 10 was .  i have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of july and august over time. the formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year.  these premiums are as follows jan . 008feb . 004mar . 001apr . 002may . 003jun . 004jul . 004aug . 004sep . 003oct . 002nov . 003dec . 006these premiums start in jan 2004on wednesday jan 2003 settled 2. 959 the 3 4 spread was marked at . 0375 the 4 5 spread was marked at .  in the old methodologyjan 2003 2. 959jan 2004 2. 9965jan 2005 2. 044in the new methodologyjan 2003 2. 959jan 2004 2. 9885jan 2005 2. 028the only change in the formula is from month x month x 1 year lookup on year on year tabletomonth x month x 1 year lookup on year on year table lookup on month premium tablethe seasonality premiums will change over time and i will let you know when i change them. ,0,2,new curve generation methodology
hey haven t had the best of months.  like you had some good positions but others wiped out everything.  unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 months and then separates completely.  the z f g and f g h flies are amazing.  something definitely out of whack.  hard to believe cash in z will be cantango to f and front spread f g will be 40.  spreads definitely implying we will see some 10 prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  hell already seeing it in the west.  the system is just broken there.  interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won t occur until latter part of the winter.  the inelasticity of demand continues to be unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.  gas can be 3 times what it was one year ago and not a significant loss of demand.  market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.  understand they are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4. 5 considering the scenario that s being painted.   globalp. on 11 21 2000 01 06 40 pm. ,0,-1,mkts

unfortunately mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind there are three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment.  however moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a vol smile theory.  in addition in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at 5 than at 4 and more volatile at 4 than 3.  thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.  second reason is heptocurtosis fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution.  third is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are bearish put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view towards market or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak. ,7,8,gas implied volatility smile

yea i think the two dumps in the market are when everybody realizes the loss of demand which is in the first 4 inj numbers.  customer buying and fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level.  if my theory holds eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes.  second puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4 on y y basis demand still weak economic weakness isn t a 3 month problem industry realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500 700 bcf in march but you should and early winter weather will not match 2000.  we develop large y y surplus in x and z.  z futures hold up because some risk premium still exists for rest of winter.  by late december just trying to find a home for gas.  think decent chance f futures finish with a 2 handle.  globalp. on 03 25 2001 08 16 26 pm. ,3,5,distillates
just when i m turning really bearish you re starting to turn bullish on me.  weather to me relatively unimportant.  yes it will leave us with 30 bcf or so less in storage than if we had mild weather.  i think it is masking a major demand problem.  think what the aga numbers would be with moderate weather.  when we get into injections i think we ll see a big push down.  spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short.  customer buying still strong.  thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer we haven t moved down.  however i think when the picture becomes clearer i. e.  when we start beating last year s injections by 20 bcf a week trade will get short.  customers very unsophistocated.  the story they keep telling us is we re coming out 400 bcf less than last year thus the summer has to be strong.  when we start inj customers will start seeing other side of story.  pira finally came out this week and said stop buying.  to me the mrkt just a timing issue.  i want to be short before the rest of the idiots get short.  i continue buying m f puts.  projecting k to settle 450 and m 400.   globalp. on 03 23 2001 01 44 10 pm. ,7,10,distillates

andy good to hear.  there continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the us two more start in the next two months.  we are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid offer regardless of whose it is.  in this framework enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system.  however we would hold the book getting to see what everyone was doing at all times.  the idea is that if we can move the industry s order flow from 30 eol to eol we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.  still working on technical issues.  the decision to open eol markets would be done on a product by product basis.  give me a call if you want to discuss.  03 13 2001 11 14 am. ,5,1,trip to houston

so my point shown a little bit right now.  weather a little cooler for this week.  overall normal for 6 10.  jv up 12 cents.  think just as customers got totally fucked last year selling into the rally they are going to buy all the way down.  differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the length.  this year trade not ready to get really short.  not until healthy inj in april anyways.  i think money from here will be made being short just question of what and when.  think there ll be enough hedging demand to keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.  with amount of inj capacity available hard to believe phys market is going to dictate prices for next couple months.  i think it will be spec and hedgers dictating.  spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.  leads to more upside potential in short term.  my point in v x was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell side leading to pressure on those spreads.  the california term power sales have totally changed that.  before the only thing customers were selling was cal 2.  now customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2 3 solely from california.  now turning neutral v x and x z.  you have very valid points.  i like q v more though.  i think you could have 10 cents of upside in that with little downside.  thoughts. ,14,18,contangos vs winter putspds

imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one pipeline running to your well.  the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way.  split connect means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you don t have to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe.  i m going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight.  are you free saturday day and night jennifer white  zdnetonebox. com on 02 09 2001 11 42 51 am. ,2,-1,....happens at la strada stays at la strada!!!
i think we would rally if march were the only thing traded.  problem is summer and on out so weak.  trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to 600.  some customer selling in cal 2.  so h j and j k need to blow out because no other spread is moving.  i m a seller of j k so h j needs to blow.  all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly.  it s a struggle each penny at this point.  at least one spread needs to break if we re going to run and i don t see that happening.  globalp. on 02 08 2001 11 20 40 am. ,4,8,spreads

this morning s 610 day forecast models are showing somewhat betteragreement.  all three models move the main cold trough axis to the greatlakes area by the last half of the period.  this shift allows for coldpolar arctic air to pour into the midwest and northeastern states bydays 9 and 10 as early as day 8 on the american .  the canadian andeuropean continue more troughing in the southern branch in thesouthwestern states keeping that area cool but also forcing continuedridging in the southern statesfrom texas to the southeastkeepingthem warmer and away from the cold.  the american eliminates thissouthern branch cold air protection early by day 8 while the canadianbreaks it down by day 10 implying that even the south would see coldweather at the beginning of the 1115 day period.  the european appearsto hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the south.  in all cases the west coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period. all three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in canadawith a plentiful supply of strong cold air. more details including early information from the ensembles will beavailable with the 6 30am et release. matt rogers. ,0,-1, earthsat update

i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late morning to go to vail.  apparently i missed a little craziness.  my point on is that forward spreads months 3 4 and back don t necessarily trade on value they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  look at k m.  do you think k cash will average 3 cents above m.  i don t really see that scenario.  yet that s what it is worth because the market says jv is worth x and to get there k m 3.  the same argument applies to .  i think this summer will be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf d more gas than last year.  but cal 2 will lag the move.  it s the main thing customers are selling right now because every equity analyst and even pira are telling their customers that cal 2 will average 3.  so either the and x z spreads come in or f g g h h j blow out.  after this winter who in there right mind wants to buy f g or g h again.  my thought is that the primary juice will be h j but and x z will be under some pressure.  i m a seller at 9 and buyer at 5 6.  not much in it either way though.   globalp. on 01 31 2001 04 47 22 pm. ,7,12,v/x

a couple of observations from here cash futures getting whacked.  whereas last weekend cash traded 1 over g this weekend will probably trade . 15 over.  the lack of weather giving the market time to regroup.  good thing because another week of cold and the system was going to break.  certainly still has that chance in feb.  saw utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting any extra demand through spot market.  in effect they said we re not withdrawing anymore so we ll buy marketers storage.  they had to encourage marketers to sell it to them so cash was extremely strong in periods of even normal demand and should continue to be if when any weather comes again.  this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in mkt.  g h getting whacked in sympathy.  probably priced 25 term deals through broker market and own originators in past two days.  24 were from the buy side.  it s as if pira came in and told everyone term was cheap.  however they ve got the opposite view.  customers just seeing gas at 4 anytime as being okay now.  don t see any let up in back support for a while.  front spreads the hardest call right now.  g h h j j k can t decide what to do with them and from the volatility in them appears neither can anybody else.  almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march hoping for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple 20 prints in cash.  probably as likely to happen in g as h and g h has much less downside.  doing well here.  actually having the best month ever 11 days in.  played front short against term length.  got out of front shorts today.  probably early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected.  will keep term length meanwhile.  i ve hated summer backwardation forever.  agree about u h.  a little less crazy about the trade now because i think the easy money was made over the past two days.  unbelievable spec demand for next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and crushed on move down.  jv xh went from 22 to 3. 5 in 5 days while front virtually unchanged. don t know what to think of this summer longer term.  certainly not as easy as it was last summer when it was obvious 3 was not equilibrium for gas.  now 6 for this summer i don t know.  we re gonna have to inject the hell out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.  but we will feel production increase hit the market.  just buy vol.  globalp. on 01 11 2001 04 48 32 pm. ,20,1,ngas and economy

redskins to stick with johnson at quarterback sept.  19 2000by len pasquarellisportsline. senior writer despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth quarter interceptions by brad johnson the washington redskins will stick with their starting quarterback for sunday night s game against the new york giants sportsline. has confirmed.  if it was just a problem with brad then we d look at it but that s not the case coach norv turner said.  but it goes beyond just the quarterback position.  it s more than that.  we re not playing well on offense in general.  redskins quarterback brad johnson will remain the team s starter against the unbeaten giants.  ap in the wake of the redskins 27 21 loss to the dallas cowboys on monday night there were rumblings washington might switch to backup jeff george for the key matchup against the undefeated giants.  the washington offense one of the league s most diverse in 1999 when it ranked no.  2 overall and second in scoring has been sporadic at best in three games.  a seventh year veteran who is in the final season of his contract johnson has five interceptions the last two games including four in the fourth quarters of those losses.  he has not been sharp in either his play calling or his execution and even some teammates suggested privately monday night that it might be time for a change.  one glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the washington offense to throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries.  the redskins have only three completions this year of more than 20 yards and the longest is 26 yards.  in monday s defeat the team s longest play was a 17 yard dumpoff to tailback stephen davis.  the redskins who averaged 12. 7 yards per completion in 1999 with both starting wide receivers averaging 18 plus yards are averaging an anemic 9. 2 yards per catch this season.  but turner who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at this point and retains confidence in johnson acknowledged the team needs new focus more than a new starter.  there hasn t been any thought to switching quarterbacks he said.  right now we need to get better at every position quarterback and everywhere else. 2 compaq. com on 09 20 2000 08 29 53 am. ,0,-1,tv

fathers put the second amendment in our constitutionwhere we re headed by robert a.  waters you re sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your bedroom door.  half awake and nearly paralyzed with fear you hear muffled whispers.  at least two people have broken into your house and are moving your way.  with your heart pumping you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun.  you rack a shell into the chamber then inch toward the door and open it.  in the darkness you make out two shadows.  one holds a weapon it looks like a crowbar.  when the intruder brandishes it as if to strike you raise the shotgun and fire.  the blast knocks both thugs to the floor.  one writhes and screams while the second man crawls to the front door and lurches outside.  as you pick up the telephone to call police you know you re in trouble.  in your country most guns were outlawed years before and the few that are privately owned are so stringently regulated as to make them useless.  yours was never registered.  police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.  they arrest you for first degree murder and illegal possession of a firearm.  when you talk to your attorney he tells you not to worry authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter.  what kind of sentence will i get you ask.  only ten to twelve years he replies as if that s nothing.  behave yourself and you ll be out in seven.  the next day the shooting is the lead story in the local newspaper.  somehow you re portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir boys.  their friends and relatives can t find an unkind word to say about them.  buried deep down in the article authorities acknowledge that both victims have been arrested numerous times.  but the next day s headline says it all lovable rogue son didn t deserve to die.  the thieves have been transformed from career criminals into robin hood type pranksters.  as the days wear on the story takes wings.  the national media picks it up then the international media.  the surviving burglar has become a folk hero.  your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you and he ll probably win.  the media publishes reports that your home has been burglarized several times in the past and that you ve been critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the suspects.  after the last break in you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time.  the district attorney uses this to allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.  a few months later you go to trial.  the charges haven t been reduced as your lawyer had so confidently predicted.  when you take the stand your anger at the injustice of it all works against you.  prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean vengeful man.  it doesn t take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.  the judge sentences you to life in prison.  this case really happened.  on august 22 1999 tony martin of emneth norfolk england killed one burglar and wounded a second.  in april 2000 he was convicted and is now serving a life term.  how did it become a crime to defend one s own life in the once great british empire it started with the pistols act of 1903.  this seemingly reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and established that handgun sales were to be made only to those who had a license.  the firearms act of 1920 expanded licensing to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.  later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of all shotguns.  momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after the hungerford mass shooting in 1987.   ryan a mentally disturbed man with a kalashnikov rifle walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw.  when the smoke cleared 17 people were dead.  the british public already de sensitized by eighty years of gun control demanded even tougher restrictions.  the seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though ryan used a rifle.  nine years later at dunblane scotland thomas hamilton used a semi automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at a public school.  for many years the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable or worse criminals.  now the press had a real kook with which to beat up law abiding gun owners.  day after day week after week the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and demanded a total ban on all handguns.  the dunblane inquiry a few months later sealed the fate of the few sidearms still owned by private citizens.  during the years in which the british government incrementally took away most gun rights the notion that a citizen had the right to armed self defense came to be seen as vigilantism.  authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened claiming that self defense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun.  citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released.  indeed after the martin shooting a police spokesman was quoted as saying we cannot have people take the law into their own hands.  all of martin s neighbors had been robbed numerous times and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences.  martin himself a collector of antiques had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars.  when the dunblane inquiry ended citizens who owned handguns were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.  being good british subjects most people obeyed the law.  the few who didn t were visited by police and threatened with ten year prison sentences if they didn t comply.  police later bragged that they d taken nearly 200 000 handguns from private citizens.  how did the authorities know who had handguns the guns had been registered and licensed.  kinda like cars.  sound familiar wake up ama this is why our founding fathers put the second amendment in our constitution.  att1. htm. ,54,62,the ultimate goal of gun control

sipping vodkaa new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardlyspeak.  after mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. the monsignor replied when i am worried about getting nervouson the pulpit i put a glass of vodka next to the waterglass.  if i start to get nervous i take a sip.  so next sunday he took the monsignor s advice.  at the beginningof the sermon he got nervous and took a drink.  heproceeded to talk up a storm.  upon his return to his office after mass hefound the following note on the door .  sip the vodka don t gulp.  there are 10 commandments not 12.  there are 12 disciples not 10.  jesus was consecrated not constipated.  jacob wagered his donkey he did not bet his ass.  we do not refer to jesus christ as the late j.  c.  the father son and holy ghost are notreferred to as daddy junior and the spook.  david slew goliath he did not kick the shit out of him.  when david was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey don tsay he was stoned off his ass.  we do not refer to the cross as the big t.  when jesus broke the bread at the last supper hesaid take this and eat it for it is my body.  he did notsay eat me 12.  the virgin mary is not called mary with the cherry. ,14,-1,lo que hace el la bebida

i was just thinking about the thing too.  i bought a book at barnes noble 100 best family resorts in north america.  i found the name of one place that i have seen in the past in magazines that i always thought looked good high hampton inn and country club in north carolina.  another place that i have seen is something like blackberry farm in tennessee.  both meet the criteria of mountains in the carolina tennessee range.  i will get info on both and we can look at it.  i worry a little bit about having such a range of ages that i want to make sure that we go someplace where there is plenty to do for all just sitting for some shopping eating golf etc.  these two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough variety.  i thought that i would also get some info on some other places that may not have popped up on mom and dad s list but that might be good for the whole family.  one of those might catch their interest as well.  i can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to mom and dad that the thought of this trip could wear thin.  i would like the opportunity to be together with everyone maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night even though dad is doing so much better you never know when you will have the chance to get everyone together on a trip like this.  memory maker or nightmare could be a toss up but maybe worth the try.  let s share some research and see if there is any place that we could get excited about going.  cindy white  viviance. com on 01 05 2001 10 41 33 am. ,0,-1,anniversary

i have always worked right up until my due date.  there is a lot of waiting and somehow i thought that the time passed more quickly if i was in the office in my normal routine.  meagan was due on wednesday may16.  i set my last date of work for friday may 11.  mom came in that weekend for mothers day you were with her right and then we did stuff the next couple of days until meagan was born.  with amanda i owned the shop at the time and i was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  she was a week late so we just didn t know what to expect.  tyler s due date was december 18 and i set my last day of work for the friday before that date.  of course then he was late but we were in the throws of remodeling so i was out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  a lot of this probably depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have everything at the house ready.  i still had a lot of energy at the end of my pregnancies and i had also managed to get rooms ready early so i enjoyed working as long as i could.  definitely make a point of you and chris going to some movies at the theater before the baby comes.  you won t be able to do that for quite a while afterwards white cara  texas. usta. com on 12 28 2000 12 51 02 pm. ,14,-1,welcome back
i saw kim s response to stephen douglas but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on going basis that this will be kept up.  i sent the note below to kim.  i am sure that she manages well but i think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization.  it is likely that when stephen reads her note that he will call me and tell me that he still doesn t know when this task will be completed.  that was his concern yesterday and kim s note really doesn t address that.  if she doesn t have an estimated completion date then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task.  kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions or i will be the one that gets the phone calls.  the ena organization must develop confidence in others on our team.  let s help kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs stephen and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs. ,7,-1,ena rmt confirmations

do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the notation is that information is being compiled my guess would be that the one commodity that is up to date financial power is the one with the lowest number of transactions.  that means that the lion s share of the work is still to be done.  are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner as i mentioned to you before i would not hesitate enlisting jeff sorenson to do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done promptly.  let me know if you need his help and i will visit with brent price.  i know that brent would support jeff s involvement to get his caught up.  who specifically will be responsible on an on going basis to handle for the rmt confirmations will we have some sort of report that we can send to stephen each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he is comfortable on an on going basis that this is being kept up to date   s  12 27 2000 05 51 pm. ,5,-1,ena rmt confirmations

hope your long weekend was a good one uneventful on monday at least.  got your message last friday.  it seems as if kristin is more and more interested in the ebs role especially after her continuing discussions with jim fallon.  the timing of her trip to london is somewhat up in the air.  may be the end of this week may be next week.  i think it will still be good for you and kristin to talk in person.  kristin and todd are both very qualified and you would love working with both.  kristin s established working relationship with jim fallon would definitely be a plus.  i don t want to lose both of them from ena however at the same time.  so i would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.  i got your message on housing location in houston.  i am headed out of the office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ena s office of the chairman.  i will call you on friday when i am back in the office and talk through some options on housing. ,0,-1,update
we did talk about the creation of these new positions within gas support.  i have also discussed this at length with brent and agree that the shift of manager positions to front to back looks across each region eliminating the oa and deal validation manager roles makes sense.  upon the recommendation of susan and brent i am comfortable with appointing jeff gossett as the manager of the west region.   04 17 2000 10 46 am. ,0,-1,reorganization/promotion

crazy week 7 00 pm and i just finished a project for delainey that i got at noon today.  cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed ever since.  patti gave me your message with your home number around 5 30 today just as she was leaving apologized for not giving it to me earlier.  however given my immediate project i don t think that i could have called until now.  and at 1 00am london time i think that this e mail is much better.  i am still really crunched tomorrow morning.  all of our mid year reviews must be completed by the time we have our ena office of the chair staff meeting at 2 30 tomorrow.  big push after an over percentage completion rate of about at our ena meeting two weeks ago.  some of those unfinished reviews were mine to give 16 direct reports is a killer .  i wrote three last night after tyler went to bed finished at 1 00 am and gave all three reviews this morning.  i have 5 more to write tonight and to deliver tomorrow morning to be at .  i will try to call you on my way into the office tomorrow morning from the car.  if i miss you then it will be late afternoon houston time before i could call you.  next week shapes up to be much better.  i am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.  would love to have to over here and involved in operations.  so i will either catch you from my car tomorrow morning or we can talk on monday. ,0,-1,stuff

i scheduled this meeting in houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our enron speakers the hill country or even galveston was going to make it impossible for jeff skilling to join us.  i would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town.  i have preliminarily reserved rooms for all of you at the wyndham warwick.  part of the reason for this forum is to meet and get to know your counterparts in other enron operating companies and from around the world.  if you can stay at the hotel this team building will probably be enhanced.  this memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for sunday and monday nights.  i hate the sunday thing but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away this best suited their schedules.  please let patti know on thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate. ,3,2,world-wide operations controller forum - rooms

while recruiting on campus recently i became aware that a decision was made at the program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  in talking with students and faculty at the university of texas and university of oklahoma it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with enron as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 2001 interns.  i have communicated my concerns to lexi elliott and her manager shelley jones and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a program level based on enron s staffing.  when i asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews i was even more concerned to discover that neither lexi nor shelley had that data.  it would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our analyst and associates programs.  i have had conversations over the last two weeks with lexi and shelley with no resolution.  when they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns i volunteered to have james scribner a senior director on my team obtain this market information.  lexi and shelley either did not have the time to gather this data or were not sure how to do so.  they were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information.  i now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at ut and ou this fall for summer intern positions.  and based on this information i believe that enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall.  while my research only touches on two of the schools at which enron recruits i want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.  as administrators of the program you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the enron message to campus.  i believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two way messaging system.  i strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for enron extremely quickly as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  i suspect that many enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the program s decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships.  in working with rick causey and mike mcconnell executive sponsors for ut and ou respectively they are as concerned as i about the decision on interviewing summer interns.  i have copied both of them on this note to the two of you.  please let me know how this can be resolved.  with the help of james scribner and others we have already compiled a list of students at ut and ou that should be targeted for summer internships.  i will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the program to devise creative ways to turn this around. ,3,10,hiring practices for summer interns

nan. ,0,-1,a note being sent out under john sherriff's name - your
thoughts on the cover note i think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards but i wonder about the most appropriate timing enough of a global message and the means of delivery.  on the means of delivery i am not sure from your note whether or not i fully understand the intent.  is there an article to be included in an enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under john s name if so to whom will the letter be sent or is the letter from john an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article with regard to a global message i think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities.  with these operating standards implemented worldwide we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.  these global standards also should enable enron to expand its business reach more quickly with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations.  i am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  finally a question regarding timing.  the last i knew after you and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated shona took this to do after brent s return to houston for comments to all business controllers.  i don t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed understand and have implemented these standards.  and not to belittle the process of creating the standards the tough part and the real meat behind this will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.  my commitment to rick causey is that i will have that global report in production by the end of the year.  there is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  shona has commissioned  moscoso to work on this and i believe that  has already been working with james new.  so i question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.  would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buy in and commitment to these standards and hopefully our first draft of a meaningful exception report sorry that this response looks so long.  i have been interrupted 20 times while responding so i hope that it makes sense. ,0,-1,nan

whew your schedule makes me tired i am sure that brigeda is happy that you are involved in so many activities with her school and then on the other hand sometimes you wonder if they notice work sounds crazy for you but how nice that you will be off from december 21 until the 2nd.  i hope that make it over the week before christmas.  the week is kind of crazy for us so i am trying to find a time that will work.  sunday the 17th we are having a dessert party at our house inviting neighbors old huntwick friends etc.  it is for families and meagan and amanda each included 4 of their friends in the invitiation list along with their familities.  it will be multi generational i hope fun as it would be a nice tradition to continue.  on monday i think that david plans to take tyler and amanda to longview for a visit.  a commitment that meagan and i have to sort toys at northwest assistance ministries from 12 30 to 4 00 that day has excused us from the trip.  so it may be best for meagan and me to drive over to austin after 4 00 on monday.  we could be back by the time david and company return to houston on tuesday afternoon.  wednesday we have matinee tickets to see a christmas carol at the alley theater sans tyler.  thursday i am having all of my girls in ncl over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  and friday is tyler s birthday with a 102 dalmation theme planned cake ordered from rj goodies but nothing else done yet .  so i really think that our only shot to make it to austin is for monday night which would mean only meagan and me.  i talked with mom last night and invited dad and her to houston for christmas.  i don t really think that they will come but if they do i hope that doesn t mess up your christmas.  they have only been here for one or two christmases with us since we have had kids.  i think that tyler at 3 this year will be particularly enthralled.  and next year they will have 2 grandchildren in austin so it just seemed that this could be a good year for them to come.  she said she would think about it and i told her that i wanted her to know that we would love to have them but that it was perfectly okay if they decided that they did not want to come.  how about dad playing golf this week what a difference i am so glad that he is doing better.  i hear you about mom.  i think that a blow up or some drama is highly predictable unfortunately.  she seems to do that a lot at special occassions for cara doesn t she i will certainly help in any way i can.  and i will be very interested in the gosipy details.  happy baking i do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow night so that i can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on saturday armed with 27 packages of fudge.  cindy white  viviance. com on 12 07 2000 09 25 44 am. ,0,-1,baby shower

too late with your spreadsheet.  the instructions that we got from donna were that i should review the resumes pass them to brent for his review and then on to causey for his review.  considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review that would have been an impossible task to complete by thursday at noon.  i received the resumes after lunch on tuesday just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for oklahoma.  i asked patti to make a copy of the packet for brent and i knew that rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first.  i reviewed as many of the resumes as i could on the plane on the way back to houston today all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes and brent reviewed them last night after his training class.  we got those to rick today by noon as he was leaving the office.  i believe that rick will review what brent and i put together and then will pass the resumes along to you.  since you only e mailed your spreadsheet this morning after brent and i had done our reviews you will have to cross reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  brent and i would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well.  i would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review.  the plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical and i should not have had to make the copies for brent.  if you are going to ask vp s and md s to help in this process in a very short time frame then i would suggest that you use their time wisely.  if someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by gpa s or majors that would have given us a good starting point instead of a jumble of resumes.  two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of mba s included which should be considered for associates interviews not analysts interviews.  please give us organized information to react to not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  all of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process but we need to be able to rely on the program for some basic administrative and organizational work.  i send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role not being critical.  i hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.  brent and i and i am sure hunter too would have appreciated. ,5,8,ut resumes

i like the trip idea better than a party personally so i am glad that mom and dad seemed to like that alternative.  and in june i think that the mountains sound great.  i have a preference for western mountains big open sky grand tetons could be great but if mom pictures north carolina as the spot i am sure that we can find something good.  we were in ashville a couple of years ago which was very near the blue ridge.  we stayed at a place that was supposed to be terrific but we did not care for it.  i am sure that there are other places in the area to research.  there may also be some spots around charlottesville also just off the blue ridge.  i think that some people from here have vacationed in that area so i will ask around and see if there are any good suggestions.  in magazines i have seen pictures of places in tennessee and georgia i guess they do have mountains that look nice.  i will see if i can find the names of those places. ,0,-1,anniversary
the record on friday showed that 127 employees from energy operations had pledged dollars to the campaign.  large number but still percentage wise smaller than we would like.  i sent the message below to all energy operations employees on friday afternoon.  we ll see in a few days if this helped on contributions.  text of e mail message to energy operations employees two weeks ago i toured the depelchin center one of the organizations that receives much of its funding from the .  i was surprised to find out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused houston children and the caring adults who will open their homes as foster parents.  i had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to the center.  learning about the important programs offered through depelchin and meeting four year old jessica and ten year old steven who were temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to have made that pledge.  enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non profit organizations.  hopefully many of you take advantage of this to stretch your charitable giving during the year.  the campaign is the one time each year that enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a difference in the lives of so many in houston.  each dollar pledged by an employee is matched by enron.  if you have not yet completed your electronic pledge please consider doing so as soon as possible.  our campaign draws to its conclusion next wednesday august 23.  i hope that each one of you will consider making a pledge.  there is no gift that is too small because cumulatively all enron employees can make a significant positive impact for houston.  log on to http unitedway. enron. to complete your pledge card. ,4,-1,united way

i got your voice mail message and i understand your concerns around todd s time.  i think we have it backwards for james to dictate how and when todd s help would be needed.  i think that we can review the to do list from james and get back with him on how much of that we can help with who would do it what the timing would be how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing the work etc.  as i said originally i knew that todd would not be interested nor available for a month s worth of work.  todd s tendency remember this with weather too is to think that he has to do all of the work himself.  he has had enough experience that his organization guidance and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work himself.  if james list looks long and involved how could todd lead these efforts what kind of team might he ask james to provide what additional short term resources might we be able to tap into in houston etc.  we have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to james.  if you are willing i would be glad to explore this with todd and challenge him to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort but not do all of the work.  i want him to think like a consultant on these projects not as the contracted hired help let me know what you think.    a 08 17 2000 03 55 am. ,0,1,todd hall

not surprisingly the organization is moving faster than rick buy s vacation schedule.  our meeting is set with mark frevert rick buy you and me on august 28 two weeks from next monday dictated by rick buy s schedule.  i am concerned that waiting that long to get with mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve.  mike mcconnell and jeff shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the global markets team which will include a discussion on brent s role and reporting responsibilities.  brent and scott earnest are flying to london next monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  many of their discussions will be with mike jordan and some logical points will be raised around co ordination between eel and egm.  in a conversation with gary hickerson on tuesday regarding his business he stated that he wanted to be sure that i had responsibility over london operations as he will have support personnel in london and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated.  separately jeff shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with brent in the operations cao role but that he wanted brent to report to me to ensure consistency access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  i told him that you and i had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for london and that we had a meeting planned with mark frevert on august 28.  that s a lifetime to a trader and jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month.  what are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with mark frevert the summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  i have checked mark s travel schedule.  he will be in the houston office next week with thursday august 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  i am not trying to rush this process yet i know that by the end of august much will have been decided around coordinating between ena egm and eel operations.  i would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions rather than arrive at the party late. ,1,8,meeting with mark frevert - should we move it up?

to give you more clarity stephen transferred to ebs effective july 1 2000.  his move to ebs was agreed to earlier in 2000 with the understanding that it would be effective upon the completion of the sap implementation for ena on july 1.  stephen was playing a critical role in ena to insure a smooth transition for sap and todd lindholm at ebs was in agreement that stephen would remain an ena employee through implementation with his performance review being based on his work for ena.  stephen is very talented and will no doubt do a great job at ebs.  during the first 6 months of 2000 however his heart was already at ebs and he failed to communicate with my other direct reports on sap issues consistently missed my staff meetings recruited our other key sap expert to ebs without a back up plan for ena etc.  it was his failure to make his sap assignment a priority that landed him in the needs improvement category relative to other directors on my team.  it is the relativity of his performance that is key not necessarily the label of that category. ,5,4,needs improvements for managers & directors

today was the final ena prc.  relative ranking results up through the senior director level are final.  you and your management team can begin the process of giving performance reviews to your employees.  i spoke with  walton today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting the employee reviews.  she indicated that the target completion date should be the end of july.  promotions will be effective august 1st.  it is dave delainey s intent to announce ena promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on july 24.  this drives the end of july target completion date for reviews.  i do not yet know if delainey wants all ena promotions to be announced in a single memo or if each group within ena will prepare such a memo.  i will keep you updated on this as i get direction from him.  please note the following change since our energy operations prc in june.  in order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid year review process we will not share performance clusters with employees when conducting their reviews.  it is very important for all of us to be consistent in this process so please communicate this to all in your groups who will be giving performance reviews.  it is important to note however that the content of an employee s review should be consistent with our view of that employee s relative ranking.  in other words an employee in the satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that the employee is doing a great job.  clearly a large number of employees performed at a higher level than those employees in the satisfactory category so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in the organization help you achieve the groups goals etc. ,0,2,update on prc process

bob is a good solid player.  he won t change the world but he is diligent about getting a prescribed job done.  i personally like bob a lot and am very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  his wife has ms in its most severe stages.  he was a manager previously and we jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  he needs to be able to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  i made a personnal commitment to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and predictable end to his work day and as long as he is in my group i will personally make sure that works for him.  i would hope for him that if he ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.  danny contacted me about bob more from the standpoint of asking me what impact it would have on gas if he moved.  i suggested that brent would be better able to address that.  i did tell danny that the onslaught of eol transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations and i am sure that they are not long on people.  i assume that danny is following up with brent.     enron communications 06 13 2000 03 47 pm. ,0,2,bob bowen

per my earlier e mail message i am forwarding to you the draft of the report on the operations controls review of singapore.  it is an attachment to the message from scott earnest to me.  the most current drafts of the reports on oslo and frankfurt were compiled by the aa team in london.  nick swingler is apparently out on vacation this week.  i have asked aa personnel from houston to coordinate with their london office to get you a copy of those two draft reports.  given the time difference you should receive thos reports via e mail from aa on wednesday. ,0,4,draft of singapore office findings

i have attached a listing of planned prc meetings for operations that will be held in houston.  there will be a number of pre review meetings that will be held over the next two weeks in preparation for an energy operations prc meeting to be held on friday december 8th.  the pre meetings are necessary due to the sheer size of the groups.  in addition to the meetings detailed in this schedule brent s team in egm is having pre meetings as well.  the december 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ena egm and eim.  we will review the results from the pre review meetings for senior specialists and below.  i have asked that the results from the pre review meetings mirror the preferred distribution which as you probably know suggests that of the population will not receive a bonus and should therefore be in the bottom two categories.  assuming that appropriate work has been done at the pre review meetings this review on the 8th should not be too lengthy.  we will take considerably more time as we review the managers who will have been pre ranked as well.  this will give us a good jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  we will then review and rank the directors and senior directors.  we will also be discussing suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  finally assuming that i still have david oxley and wes colwell captive and attentive i will discuss my suggested rankings for the three vp s who report to me.  we will of course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels that we are reviewing initial make up of the december 8th prc is me and my direct reports within ena brent and his direct reports within egm and brenda herod from eim.  i have also extended an invitation to louise kitchen to attend the december 8th meeting.  i do not know yet if she will attend.  do you have some suggestions for cross calibrating on a global basis this year i think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the year to help facilitate this.  would you like to attend the meeting here in houston on december 8th is there a planned meeting in london that would make sense for me to attend let me know your thoughts.    11 24 2000 04 28 am. ,9,16,cross calibration for operations people globally
brent price and i will be in the london office next week arriving monday morning and returning to houston on friday.  the purpose of my visit is in regard to my global risk management operations role i believe that rick causey met with you regarding some operations support that brent and i will provide to fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of michael jordan the jp morgan staffer that fernley has hired.  brent and i will be working with fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for fernley during that transition period.  we will also map out an enron trading operations introduction for michael jordan which may involve a short stint for him in houston.  my goal is to provide a strong resource to fernley during this transition period and to work with fernley to provide whatever assistance training and orientation to michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible.  another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with fernley and his business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000.  i know that barry and richard sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all enron locations with trading operations.  my earlier trips to london this year were focused solely on helsinki and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience.  i value input from other trading operations professionals and i look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with barry richard and some of their direct reports.  i also contacted tani nath about my trip to see how i could support her as she moves into her role in global products.  i have not heard from tani but i understand from others that she will be in the houston office next week.  it will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip but based on my commitments in houston and rick causey s desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to fernley next week is the best for me to be in london.  i did meet with tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over global products.  i trust that she will contact me for that support as needed.  i have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while i am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in london.  i look forward to meeting with you next week.  this trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations control review that we are conducting at joe sutton s request.  by circumstance as you know we have taken a look at helsinki and subsequently oslo and frankfurt.  there will be a similar review of continental power uk gas uk power and global liquids.  the review teams are currently focused on operations controls reviews of north american locations and some entities in the us in which enron has a large ownership position.  it is likely that the continuation of this effort in london will occur in mid april.  copies of the drafts of the findings for oslo and frankfurt were provided to fernley as soon as the team returned to houston.  we hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from fernley and the business managers in oslo and frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies so i will have those forwarded to you today.  the sydney and singapore trip was a lengthy one as it also involved a last leg of the trip in london with regard to support for singapore.  the houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with aa on an early draft last friday.  i can also provide you with a draft of that report the completion of which was pending input from bill bradford early this week he made the trip but was out of the office last week .  we did do a preliminary review of the sydney and singapore findings with rick causey and rick buy on friday afternoon to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  they understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them. ,11,0,trip to london next week
i didn t get a response from you regarding my e mail that i sent last week but i have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to houston next week.  my plans for being in london next week are firm so it looks as if we will miss one another.  my offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role so i trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed.  i will look forward to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide with effective exception reporting.  this is a key initiative for 2000 and will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities. ,0,1,trip to london
i have asked my assistant patti to help me in setting up meetings for next week and i had asked her to arrange a lunch with you and brent plus some time for just the two of us to get together.  we are continuing the worldwide operations controls review at the request of the two rick s causey and buy .  that will include a look at continental power uk power uk gas and global products.  looks as if sometime in april will be the date for that however not .    03 14 2000 08 29 am. ,0,-1,next week

attached is a referral and resume on an hr professional that i thought might interest you.  the referral comes from james scribner a guy that has just accepted a job offer from me.  james and i worked together previously at a bank and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.  when i asked if he knew of any other talented people at fleming his current employer that we should know he immediately suggested tana.  his read is that she is very bright creative and innovative.  she has worked on many special projects at fleming but james believes that she would certainly consider a generalist role as she learned enron and would then earn her way into managing special projects.  i thought that i would give ena a first look at this candidate.  if you are not interested or do not have a need please pass this referral along to other hr groups.  fyi james will start work here on april 3. ,0,3,resume for tana cashion

i won t bury you with constant examples but am copying you on this note regarding floor meetings.  while operations is now a part of enron net works i believe that the only meaningful piece of that to philippe and greg is our commercialization effort.  they are not in the habit of considering the 500 people who provide critical services to ea egm and eim daily.  floor meetings set by greg and philippe were apparently aimed at the it teams and yet my group has added over 500 employees to net works in houston alone with our reorganization late last fall.  i will diligently work with philippe and greg on this on an on going basis.  while not fully embraced as part of net works my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key enron businesses that we support.  i suspect that motivating and managing in this environment will become increasingly challenging.  this is an fyi more than anything else. ,0,3,suggestions for floor meeting locations

an update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town due diligence teams for acquisitions identifiedi have worked with my operations controllers in ews and have identified a short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on potential acquisitions.  we have identified our target teams for due diligence efforts around commodities.  while each person on the list has other duties currently all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted to projects as they arise.  i will review this list continually and update it as i identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent job as part of a due diligence team.  i mentioned that kristin albrecht had created a due diligence check list while she was in london on the mg acquisition.  we will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this checklist so that all are prepared.  let me know if you are interested in the names on my list.  also let me know if there is a pending due diligence effort.  dedicated support named for transportation businessi met with dan reck and chris kravas week before last and have reviewed the executive summary from the consulting team.  i followed up with brent price my operations controller for egm to review his plan for creating an appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  currently todd hall and mike perun on brent s team are assessing what needs to be done.  todd has other responsibilities and dan reck was concerned about the amount of time that todd would have.  brent has since recruited shelley stubbs to play the lead role over operations integration for webmodal.  she will be returning to houston from the london office by the end of march.  she will be able to split her time starting next week to focus on webmodal.  todd will stay involved until shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of march.  we will also keep mike perun on the assignment working for shelley.  shelley is expected to be in houston next week and i will sit in on meetings with her next week regarding our plans.  i will keep you posted. ,0,-1,follow up items

i made the decision last week to disband the strategic initiatives team which reported to mary solmonson within my organization.  the group was led by a director and consisted of 2 managers 1 senior specialist and 4 specialists.  the employees were made aware of this decision last friday afternoon.  my hr rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive in finding new assignments within enron through the enron corp.  re deployment team.  mary solmonson continues as one of my direct reports focused on commoditylogic and our business development efforts regarding the commercialization of mid and back office services.  as part of my on going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of service within energy operations i reviewed core versus non core activities within my team.  i am committed to investing appropriately in people resources to support core activities.  and i believe that we can become even more effective if investments in non core activities are eliminated.  the role played by the strategic intiatives team in coordinating systems projects will be more appropriately shouldered by the it project leads and the respective business sponsors end users.  the middle man role played by the strategic initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.  i wanted you to be aware of my decision in case you hear anything about the re deployment effort. ,6,0,fyi - disbanding of group within energy operations

doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale businesses.  ebs and ees will be included in 2001.  the controls around mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test i. e.  following the process and documentation around a series of transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of explaining what we think happens.  doing a deal test tells us what does happen.  and it is when there are differences between the controls that we believe to be in place and what actually happens that we identify where operational and perhaps financial risk is created.  these reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which enron has contracted with arthur andersen.  as such they are purposely designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than aa s reviews and to produce less paperwork.  it is both the quick assessment of control gaps and potential operational risk and the quick solutions to correct these that are valuable in these reviews.  these reviews also look for ways to leverage success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  briefly the doorstep review process would follow this set of steps 1 cross functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  this is usually unannounced but key personnel in the subject office may be notified of the review a few days prior to the team s arrival to be certain that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town.  2 doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co operation in making information and personnel available to complete the review.  3 the review is conducted including information sessions with key commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and key control operations personnel to understand the business processes.  the deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  4 the doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of the review which includes both controls that are working well and those which may not be working as designed.  potential action items are suggested.  this information is reviewed with the head of the office as they are usually very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support their business.  there are times when the head of an office will suggest an additional point to be added to the list of action items knowing that with this focus he she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support the growth of their business.  the doorstep team lets the head of the office know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing so.  5 starting late in 2000 the findings from doorstep reviews would next be reviewed with ted murphy and me.  ted s viewpoint would be from risk controls and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  ted and i assisted by cassandra schultz and shona wilson would work with appropriate personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  then on a quarterly basis ted and i would meet with rick buy and rick causey to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter doorstep findings that had been handled updates on any outstanding doorstep findings and plans for the next quarter.  through most of 2000 the doorstep teams met with rick and rick within a few days of returning from each doorstep review.  this immediate feedback step was passed to ted and me sometime late in 2000.  we did agree that we would meet with rick and rick before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more timely manner than quarterly.  steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in germany.  shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors in charge of the scrap metal business.  her impression was that they were not concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with enron s practices.  shona also debriefed with mike jordan and i believe that fernley was involved in that session as well.  at my suggestion she also contacted joe gold to inform him of her findings.  i do not know what the timing was for joe to get back to shona relative to rick buy s e mail message.   i understand that you may have felt blind sided by the e mail from rick buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  and if that was the case i apologize for that.  while shona did debrief with mike and fernley i know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  if you would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when they review businesses that are managed by eel we can certainly add that as a clear step from this point going forward.  the out of the ordinary step in this doorstep review was shona s call to rick buy and rick causey to alert them to the doorstep team s concerns over irregular payment methods and the level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing directors.  i attribute that to a miscommunication between shona and myself.  although we had changed the process at year end so that the download after doorstep was to be with ted and me as shona and i voice mailed back and forth she thought that i had asked that she initiate a meeting with rick and rick.  this meeting should have been with ted and me.  in leaving a voice mail for the two rick s about setting up a meeting shona mentioned some concerns.  rick buy is the one that called her back and asked for more detail.  she definitely covered both the teams findings and the integration plan that was underway with rick buy.  we don t however control which points rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  to reiterate the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  the effort here is to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire enron organization.  the key is quick discovery and quick resolution.  the findings create a dialogue between the business units rac and operations which i believe is healthy.  we purposefully have chosen not to over wordsmith the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be surfaced through these reviews.  frankly i believe that these reviews can reveal things that are sometimes missed in aa s reviews from a practical perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  i would be glad to discuss any details of the with you.  we certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as valuable input for you in managing eel s business.  mike jordan and certain members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other businesses outside eel later in the year.  we are certainly open to any suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process. ,12,39,doorstep

kathryn corbally senior director currently in investor relations is moving to connecticut soon to join her husband.  he has been working up there for the last six or eight months he was one of the group that defected from our weather derivatives team about a year ago.  she hopes to continue to work for enron has been talking with investor relations and some other groups that i can t remember and to do so either out of her home or in enron s new york office.  it struck me that depending upon needs at mg s new york office that kathryn could be someone for you to consider.  she came originally from the london office you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her.  in london she ran mid and back office that was in very early days for eel so most of the job was probably accounting.  she came to houston and has done a number of different things.  i think that she is well organized and control minded.  understands enron s business.  managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  i am not sure that people enjoy working under her.  that could be old news however.  there are a number of people here in houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience.  do you know of her just thought that i would mention her as a potential resource in new york.  don t know what your short and longer term needs are there.  she would definitely represent an enron point of view.  they have two small daughters she might be interested in something part time even.  could mean lower cost that way.  this idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.  if you do want to consider this i will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her.  let me know. ,0,-1,off the wall?
yes let s plan on my house on sunday.  i have to leave for the airport after the meeting off to exotic dallas and that will just make it that much easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  hearing it from a woman s point of view would be interesting i agree that it is too close to plan a dad s event for this weekend.  another thought continuing the baseball theme from last year is to get tickets to an astro s game.  i have season tickets through enron and can buy blocks of tickets for games.  i have the schedule at home and i will check tonight to see if there is perhaps a pre season game in march that would work.  we could discuss that and other sugtions at the meeting on sunday.  i will also bring info on other symphony dates in case we have a large number of girls who will take the sat on march 31.  if not too many are tied up we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10 30 and then the girls who take the sat could join us for lunch if they would like. ,0,-1,ncl
fyi i will meet with james on friday when he is back from london to go over the change in reporting for him.  i gave his review the end of last week but didn t get to review the reporting change.  i will ask patti to let you know when i am meeting with james on friday.  wanted you to be in the loop on this particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys i want this to be well done.  the training may be great i just wanted to make sure that james knew about avril s trip and that he was aware of the content and delivery on the training.  looks like he still has some homework to do. ,4,-1,entelligence training

i had the same reaction.  we didn t get much of a break between the january and february meeting was it car care and car safety that we had planned for feb and do we have a volunteer to host the meeting i could certainly host if needed.  did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the girls about car safety i would be glad to call them and make arrangements if you let me know.  any ideas on car care seems like joy martin mentioned her husband as a possible expert there.  or should we try to call firestone or jiffy lube or one of those spots to get a speaker i am headed to calgary for wednesday and thursday this week but can make plenty of phone calls before i leave.  on nominating committee i have a list of offices held over the years by the girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.  i would be glad to meet with the girls on the committee either thursday night i land from calgary around 6 00 pm friday night or saturday.  i can get you this list if you need to meet with the committee before then.  it may be tough to get the girls together but am i correct in assuming that they need to present a slate at our feb meeting and then they vote in march the symphony open rehearsal sounds good 10 30 am on saturday march 31 buy tickets at the door 4 .  problem is that sat s are given that day.  meagan is signed up to take them.  i wonder how many others may be taking the sat that day if there are only a few conflicts we could go ahead and it s okay if meagan misses.  if we have a lot of conflicts then this may not work.  maybe we could get merritt to e mail this question to the girls when she contacts them about this weekend s meeting.  they could check their schedules and then we could get a count.  i will also look into other possible dates and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.  i will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today.   gary smithey  houston. rr. com on 02 04 2001 03 11 39 pm. ,0,-1,ncl

along with mike mcconnell i am active in recruiting for enron s analyst program at the university of oklahoma.  we became involved in recruiting there two years ago when i learned about a targeted undergraduate program that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.  ou transformed their old plm petroleum land management program into the energy management program in the school of business.  this undergraduate degree retains the geology business law and other specialized classes that were part of the plm program but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a trading floor course.  with the added plus of many of these students growing up in or around energy families in oklahoma or texas i thought that recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to enron.  our recruiting efforts at ou continue to be successful and our ou energy management graduates have done well at enron.  our first hire from ou and the top energy management student was jody crook.  he joined the analyst program last february after a december 1999 graduation.  his first rotation has been on my team working as a risk book administrator in gas trading.  he is in the process of looking for a second rotation at the end of february and i think that he is someone that you should consider for a rotation on your team.  in addition to this last year s risk experience at enron jody worked as a landman for two summers for burlington resources.  i was very involved in recruiting jody to enron.  i think very highly of him and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the analyst program.  his background and your business seem to be a good fit.  please visit with jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.  it will be well worth your time. ,9,6,recommendation for analyst rotation - jody crook

amy and alec are definitely welcome actually we had already planned on amy and alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter our flower girl who is about 4 years old.  we have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so amy and alec should be fine.  i talked to grandma and she said julie wouldn t be able to make it so i already knew about that.  don t worry about having 4 more people the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn t want to open up the flood gates but most of them already live in houston or aren t going to make it to houston until late friday.  as far as the bill just let me know what you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  the food bill with tax and tip will be about 1 350.  we are very appreciative to have both our parent s help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  however we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self sufficient.  also we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents standards.  we could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference.  also i know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  the bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance.  our most important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time.  while i am on the subject i hope your mother and grandma ina aren t going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinner.  if you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because i don t want them to be offended but i can t change who zooey and i are.  just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man james cook and the matron of honor amber and then probably ending in zooey and me doing a quick toast.  we would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or betty joyce is going to get offended and don t want to stay i understand.  also do you know if skipper is planning to attend.  we haven t received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  as to this weekend i am going to try to stop by but don t have a car so just depends what is going on.  i will be in dallas so if mark is coming over saturday afternoon i could get a ride from him.  i ll try to talk to him and see if that works.  finally we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us if you have any questions please call me tonight at the house.  nlrb. on 09 19 2000 12 57 00 pm. ,0,-1,plans

privileged and confidential attorney client communicationthis e mail contains legal advicein the barbed wire purchase agreement is the provision that the purchaser has 45 days to identify those employees of company whom it would like the company to terminate from employment prior to closing.  the seller is providing a limited indemnity for purchaser s actions in selecting those employees.  the indemnity expressly excludes claims against ena for the selection of those employees.  this indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the basis of age sex race religion etc.  the indemnity exclusion also could be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference. thus if ena is going to exercise its right to select company employees under that provision ena will assume the risk of claims by affected employees.  i can assist you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and determining methods to manage the risks of those claims. let me know if you would like to discuss this issue.  x3 6401. ,0,-1,barbed wire -- privileged and confidential
your plan sounds good to me.  you all have done a good job of researching this data and i believe we are in a strong position. my one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting resumes from them.  what is the harm in accepting them are we obligated to interview the candidate given this situation it is possible that telling them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason especially since their proven track record is only for one placement.  it does not appear as if they are flooding us with resumes.  let me know if my assumption is not correct. also i am not sure your apology is necessary.  it certainly is well intentioned but i wouldn t want it to be construed as some sort of admission of wrongdoing.  so unless you feel compelled . ,0,-1,contracting solutions
i will defer to your expertise on whether we should actively accept resumes from cs at this time.  i think the way to couch it is that we do not want to receive them at this time but that they are free to check with us in a couple of months to see whether that has changed.  that way we aren t making it an absolute ban. ,0,-1,contracting solutions

hello an ena employee wrote a book that was published in russia.  there have been three editions and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.  the topic is technical analysis which is what she does here at enron.  in this 4th edition she will be using public data her own pc and working on her own time.  however given that she has been at enron for 6 months she obviously would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the book.  she would not divulge any enron confidential or proprietary information however. what are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this she is willing to let enron be a co author although as a practical matter i do not think that would be worthwhile.  my opinion at this point is that she can do it so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources and of course provided that she reveals no enron specific information.  i welcome your perspective however given that this is a new one to me. ,6,-1,code of ethics/copyright question

i have reviewed the p s agreement for triple lutz.  from my perspective it generally looks fine.  i have a few comments and invite pat mackin to add any he may have in particular based on his review of section 4. in section 4. 7 c iv there is a reference to any contract obligations.  i believe this would include employment contracts which do not appear to be identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds 250k.  we may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the provisions of section 4. 13 iii . section 4. 8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not required by law.  however given that closing is pushed out so far in the future we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key personnel to stay with the company through closing.  this may be done with the buyer s consent but we may be tying our hands.  section 6. 2 e contains a similar restriction on making payments to officers directors. in addition section 4. 8 states that we won t enter into or amend any employment contracts.  we do not renew employment contracts at a single time and the contracts of key personnel may expire.  do we want to tie our hands and be prohibited from amending extending the agreements section 6. 2 l also prohibits the modification amendment of contracts with employees. in section 4. 10 the wording other than environmental laws suggests that we are not in compliance with environmental laws.  rephrasing that sentence to refer to the provision of the agreement may be preferable. in section 4. 11 d we promise that we haven t provided any gift of any kind to customers.  i don t think we can say that given that we regularly host client development outings e. g.  rodeo bbq tickets golf tourneys etc.  and provide enron goodies to people all the time.  perhaps a limitation on de minimus gifts would be more accurate.  also a reference to our code of ethics may work here. in section 4. 13 a iii does the 250k threshhold include only  value or does it include equity grants that vest over time a reference to  payments would clarify given that people here are compensated by stock options restricted stock that vest over time. in section 4. 14 d i am not sure whether this transaction accelerates vesting pat do you know should section 7. 3 be italicized i have not seen the latest of the employee matters agreement. have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in texas for the purposes of dispute resolution  let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any other questions. ,0,2,comments to p&s agreement -- triple lutz

ok you told me nothing so i am clueless as to what is creating the distress.  maybe we can chat later. we will not be in austin in the next few months.  we are going to san antonio the first weekend in march as well as the first week in april.  the first trip is for a wedding between two friends of trey from rice mba who are marrying each other.  the other is for the  law conference which is wed.  friday.  we are not taking cameron on either of those trips party time so we will be rushing back to houston right afterwards. i am working with butch hayes at f j.  i haven t been too involved in the matter because it is not an  subsidiary but from what i can tell i like him.  any additional insight if necessary would be great. too bad you weren t in houston a couple of weeks ago.  but it probably would have been a sad time for all of you and it sounds like you don t really need that right now.  if you visit us we promise to be cheerful and frivolous if you need it not that acting that way is too much of a chore for me.  plus cameron acts like a 2 year old which is a delight.  he started at a new school a few weeks ago the post oak school a montessori school about a block from our house and he is really coming into his own.  it is amazing how much my world has both grown and shrunk since he was born.  little things like seeing a squirrel in the back yard have become major events don t even get me started on helicopters .  on the other hand i feel this enormous responsibility and desire to make sure that all is right with the world.  quite an awesome sense of obligation and discovery combined.  enough waxing philosophical.  i ve got to get out of here at some point so i d better get back to work. later.  m bmoh. on 02 15 2000 03 01 03 pm. ,13,-1,status

i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d. i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law .  we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected 60 days notice.  practically however this would not be my favorite approach.  i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer.  i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer.  does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask.  it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp.  ees broadband etc.  whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible.  we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction. let me know if you have any questions.  11 26 2000 06 50 pm. ,0,-1,triple lutz employee matters

felicia in general you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before someone can be classified as exempt.  however because there are certain exceptions to the salary basis test for example licensed attorneys do not have to meet that test it depends on what the employees are doing as to whether this situation creates a problem under the flsa. my recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.  if they do not fit within one of the exceptions we probably should have them affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the overtime rate.  you would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the overtime rate.  if they are not working over 40 hours in a week it will not be an issue. let me know if you have questions.   enron04 27 2000 05 40 pm. ,0,1,part-time exempt employees

you are right.  i remember that you wanted to be included but somehow as i was trying to get away for vacation i failed to remember to tell twanda who was setting up the meeting.  i apologize for the oversight it was not intentional.  i will make sure that you are included in any subsequent meetings.  i am sorry about this one.  basically the discussion revolved around the purpose of the prc is it a compensation system or a feedback system because the process tries to address both there is a tension between the organization s interests comp promotion etc and that of the employee feedback development etc.  this tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the fact that we have a comparative rating system.  this tension has given people lots of heartburn.  to address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn t create too much change gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we evaluate employees.  the preference was to go to numbered categories instead of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and the comparative rating.  for example a strong performer really could be excellent but compared to others in the group ended up in the third category.  for this reason the descriptor identifiers were found to be problematic.  also there will be a revamping of the explanations of the categories to get away from the old hr language.  for example a category 1. ,8,9,potential change of cluster descriptors for prc reviews

privileged and confidentialthis email contains legal advice and melissa i am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort of services for mg rw.  it looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ but that there are many whom we don t want to hire.  i am not really familiar with the specific facts here. the question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own by setting compensation controlling their activities engaging in promotion discipline termination etc.  decisions and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  so if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing with one as a contractor and one as an employee there could be some issues particularly if they share a supervisor.  unfortunately that often is the case with contract personnel. if there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers and like workers are treated similarly the risk may be reduced.  it is cleanest however to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while assume we don t want to hire them all which is the other alternative .  then the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers. i would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion.  so let s try to discuss it.  i am booked until about 11 this morning but am available after that.   enron08 08 2000 04 21 pm. ,0,-1,henry bath la

hi liz the reason ken and linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their preference.  they would like to give the jasmine suite that they are currently in to the vittors with a connecting bedroom to take care of their family. they would like mark and natalie to have the end or corner suite that the vittors have. ken and linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms hopefully on the 3rd or 4th floor.  they would like for the rooms to have the ocean view on the north side.  if that isn t possible it would be o. k.  to overlook the pool but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn t be as quiet.  the two rooms would give them everything they need with 2 baths. they said they can be reached in switzerland tomorrow.  the hotel meierhof s. ,0,10,hotel reservations

on september 22 2000 dominion transmission inc.  dti and its customers and interested state commissions continued to meet to discuss dti s upcoming tcra filing to be submitted to ferc on september 29 2000.  the customers had numerous questions for dti about why its upcoming tcra filing will result in such a large rate increase and advised dti that it needed to provide more information to the customers before they could make a meaningful response to dti s settlement proposal made on september 15 2000. dti opened the meeting by defending its upcoming tcra filing as prudent in accordance with ferc s prior orders on its tcra mechanism and legally defensible.  dti then asked for responses to its settlement proposal made last week.  the basic feedback was that the customers were not there yet.  the customers said they were still interested in discussing settlement in an effort to reduce the impact of the upcoming tcra filing but they wanted more of an explanation from dti of its proposed substantial rate increase. much of the customer s questioning focused on dti s nonpurchased fuel supply i. e.  fuel gas dti has borrowed from storage and the continued growth in this element of its fuel supply mix over the past few years.  as of june 30 2000 dti has borrowed approximately 23 bcf from storage for fuel use. dti also revealed that it had liberated approximately 13 bcf of base storage gas over the last several years i. e.  reclassified base storage gas into working gas and that this gas was still on the system.  dti said it had a 0. 31 per mmbtu basis in this gas and that it was hoping to save it for a future storage project.  the liberated gas had not yet been reflected by dti in its ferc reports or accounts.  arguably this gas has been parked in space being paid for by the customers and the customers are paying dti a return on this gas. during the bulk of the meeting the customers asked questions and dti answered them.  dti volunteered little most information had to be extracted from its representatives.  the feeling of many of the customers was that dti was not being forthright. at the conclusion of the meeting the customers said they wanted to ask more questions and would present dti with their questions in the near future.  only after they have a better sense of the facts would the customers seriously entertain settlement offers.  some customers expressed a desire for dti to terminate its tcra mechanism.  the customers also said the tcra problems need to be addressed permanently so that there is not a tcra crisis every year. accordingly dti will make its tcra filing on september 29 2000 seeking a cost increase of approximately 65 million.  it appears that the customers will protest the filing and await ferc action on the filing and protests.  in the meantime another meeting to discuss these matters has been tentatively set for october 18 2000 at 9 30 a. m.  in washington.  the meeting may be cancelled if the parties do not believe it would be useful to help resolve the issues at that time. please contact us if you have any questions about this matter. ,3,0,"dominion transmission, inc., upcoming tcra filing"

dick as we discussed today enron s analysis of bunge s energy information indicatesinadequate regulatory and pricing opportunity for enron to create additional value for bunge. electricity the predominance of electricity usage occurs in states that are either several yearsaway from enacting deregulation or where the rules are insufficiently determined at thistime to even estimate an opening date.  when opening dates are more clearly definedand we have confidence in energy curves for those markets then we could revisit thisarea of your energy profile.  natural gas bunge has taken the initiative to engage in several longer term supply and transporation agreements which have effectively managed your price therm.  for those reasons the opportunities are very limited for enron to apply a consolidation approach and providecompelling additional value for bunge. as we agreed in january the first objective was to define the potential for mutual valueand then decide what if any next steps were appropriate.  i regret we will not be able tohelp bunge at this time but know that enron will remain interested in assisting yourcompany in the future if and when market conditions afford us that opportunity.  please feel free to contact me at any time in the future if i can help answer further questionsfor you or others who have been involved in this process.  dick thank you again for providing your time and attention to this inquiry process.  sincerely  mirich. ,0,2,bunge energy analysis

mr.   here are a few questions i would like to submit before your floor meeting on the 32nd floor wednesday.  enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking assets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in new markets.  is enron going to be just a trading company .  if enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite volatile.  how could this affect our stock price will wall street be prepared to accept more volatile earnings .  volume on eol seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and new platforms are being introduced into the market place.  is this going to have a negative effect on enron s stock price .  what are some of the new markets enron plans to explore in the near future .  is broadband coming along as quickly as wall st.  expects and how much of our stock price is based on broadband i hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to discuss and i look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow. sincerely matt. ,1,9,floor meeting questions

wow what a response we have had so far. 23 players are in old news more than that now .  we need more however don t forget to spread the word if anyone you know would be interested.  i surely expect atleast 10 more to join but would love alot more.  anyway now to the important stuff. on the site.  unlike in years past i feel that people are more internet literate and can get signed up in a league without step by step instructions.  so i am going to give you the basics and you can figure it out from there.  i advise you do it sooner than later incase you have any problems.  the site is www. commissioner. com.  on the home page you will see the a place to sign into commissioner.  you must have an account with commission. to join the league.  it is the same site we used last year and your name and password should still be active.  if you don t remember it you can create a new one or there is probably somewhere that you can get them to email you your username and password.  anyway once you set up an account scroll down and select office pool manager.  our league name is .  we also have a short name of loser they might ask for that also notice no s .  the password is 3333.  you should be taken to a page to pick who you are.  your name should not be in the list.  select new player and enter your name.  this should take you to the site.  once you are in. it.  it will make it alot easier to get to it in the future.  take a look at the site.  the three main links you will be using are. 1 make picks. 2 my picks. 3 standings.  each week i think tuesday commissioner. will enter the lines on the make picks page.  these lines will stay constant untill they close the entries for the week 1 hour before first kick off includes thursday games .  you can make your picks and change your picks on this page.  to view your picks you can go to my picks.  on monday you can check the standings.  you can view it by a certain week or the yearly totals.  just click on the top on what column you will want to sort by.  that is basically it.  there are other links if you want to check them out. is a great site.  as for the rules. money will all be determined as i get an exact number of players. money will be paid out there will be weekly winners and yearly winners and loser .  the picks you make each week will be each game that week including monday nights game.  in addition to monday s game you will pick the monday night total points scored.  this tie breaker will determine weekly winners in case of any ties.  the person closest to the total will win the tie breaker absolute value .  if the absolute value is equal the under will beat the over.  example. points is 30.  player a picks 35. picks 20. wins.  player a pick 35. picks 25. wins.  don t worry it is real easy.  as for the tie breaker for the season totals.  anyone that is tied at the top will use the playoffs in the nfl as our playoffs.  i will send out the lines the site won t have them to the players involved.  you will pick all four games and the person who gets the most correct will win.  if multiple people tie then we will weed out and go on to the next weeks.  if it makes it all the way to the superbowl then we will pick the game and an over under as the ultimate tiebreaker.  don t worry if you don t make your picks one week.  you won t take a zero i am a softie .  too many people have those weeks that they can t get around to making there picks.  if i gave zeros that would kill your chances for the yearly total.  anyone that doesn t get their picks in will take all the away teams.  i will enter those picks after the deadline to enter picks.  all these games will count to the yearly total but can not win the weekly prize.  that is it for now. ya one more thing.  you can send me a check 50 to the following.  michael ner3001 hillcroft 508houston tx 77057 please don t forward this to new players.  i want to know everyone that is in.  if you know someone that is interested have them email me at  pdq. net.  i will send all this info to them when i get there interest. ,19,40,losers wanted

nice man especially 10blowjob etiquette for men from women 1.  first and foremost we are not obligated to do it.  extension to rule 1 so if you get one be grateful.  i don t care what they did in the porn video you saw it is not standard practice to cum on someone s face.  extension to rule 3 no i don t have to swallow.  my ears are not handles.  extension to rule 5 do not push on the top of my head.  last i heard deep throat had been done.  and additionally do you really want puke on your dick 7.  i don t care how relaxed you get it is never ok to fart.  having my period does not mean that it s hummer week get it through your head i m bloated and i feel like shit so no i don t feel particularly obligated to blow you just because you can t have sex right now.  extension to 8 blue balls might have worked on high school girls if you re that desperate go jerk off and leave me alone with my midol.  if i have to pause to remove a pubic hair from my teeth don t tell me i ve just wrecked it for you.  leaving me in bed while you go play video games immediately afterwards is highly inadvisable if you would like my behavior to be repeated in the future.  if you like how we do it it s probably best not to speculate about the origins of our talent.  just enjoy the moment and be happy that we re good at it.  see also rule 2 about gratitude.  no it doesn t particularly taste good.  and i don t care about the protein content.  no i will not do it while you watch tv.  when you hear your friends complain about how they don t get blowjobs often enough keep your mouth shut.  it is inappropriate to either sympathize or brag. ,0,-1,etiquette  rerun

i am attaching a copy of the ngpl that was reported as of this morning.  if you look at the by trader p l we are off from your spreadsheet by approximately 3. 6 million usd for december and approximately 7. 6million year to date.  the 7. 6 consists of the december variance and the 4 million variance that we discussed earlier originations .  however i spoke with the chris able from the controls group what we are reporting for originations and for canadian p l ties to the dpr.  this leads me to believe that either our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination adjustment was never made to the dpr.  to help resolve the december variance i have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for december.  remember the p l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  give me a call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances. ,1,6,canada p&l

i m glad to know your sister has a sense of humor and that i can quit looking over my shoulder all the time.  so what s going on down there today so far my day s much quieter than yesterday. goodness.  everyone and their brother harrassed me yesterday.  here was the best one though.  a manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his the analyst s password to the var system so i could print some reports for him the manager .  he wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his desk when he gets here at 7 30.  here s the best part though it takes about 30 minutes to print all these reports.  so essentially he was asking me to come in at 5 00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 7 30.  i told the analyst to tell him not just no but hell no i don t work for him and i have more important things to do.  if he had any questions to give me a call and i d be glad to explain further.  funny i didn t hear from him yesterday.  i was actually hoping he d call because i had had enough of doing other people s jobs yesterday and it would have been nice to chew someone out.  talk to ya later. ,0,-1,my sister

here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  once a book is officialized it must be loaded into grms before the positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  with everyone officializing books around the same time the grms que is overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into grms.  grms processes books in the order that they are officialized.  if one of your books is officialized behind either the nymex power or canadian books your book will not be loaded into grms until these books are finished.  this process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  i have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not designed to handle.  these files must then be loaded into grms.  i have to manually override post ids that for one reason or another do not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  the benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  the more books that are officialized the longer the query takes.  when books are unofficialized and reofficialized this effectively sends that book to the back of the grms que.  this means that the entire process must be started over.  now that plugging positions is no longer an option i have to spend time researching any variances that arise between the grms position and the erms position.  if the book admin and i cannot solve the problem then i have to contact the grms support team.  since this usually occurs after their regular hours it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  i cannot query new data while i m researching variances or on the phone with grms support because i need access to the information that is currently in the bench.  10 finally this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and have to shut down.  even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen it.  if you have any more questions let me know. x57478. ,0,1,benchmark process

hey what s going on things are completely crazy as usual around here.  i need another vacation i never told you about my trip did i i ve told everyone else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.  it was so much fun.  the olympics were so awesome.  i got to see the us women s basketball team play australia for the gold medal.  the crowd was soooo wild. is until we won.  and i got to see cathy freeman and marion jones run.  the whole first week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.  and the second week i spent touring all the beaches that i could find.  oh here s a funny story for you.  okay i m halfway across the world in a country known for bronze muscular sufers right so i take a day cruise around the brisbane waters one day.  these cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 80 100 people.  as we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people on the cruise.  here s the fun part. 80 of the 85 people were from a wwii veterans reunion i was on a boat full of grandpa s.  actually it was pretty funny.  this one old man sat next to me and started telling me why they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the war.  then he tells me keep in mind this man s at least 70 that he was a lifesaver lifeguard on one of the local beaches until the year before when an injury forced him to retire then he starts telling me about the war.  he said yeah i was a pow for about 9 days but they weren t feeding me very well so i left.  he had escaped from a nazi pow camp and fled to greece where he joined the greek reserve forces.  because he fought with greece in the war he s now a greek citizen.  then after the war he and some friends bought a van and traveled all over europe and asia.  when they ran out of money they d just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then they d start again.  i hope one day i have stories even half that interesting but leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out with old people how s everything going at your house what s up with this election that s all anyone s talking about around here.  talk to ya later. ,0,-1,becky

 i have learned how to prepare the ngp l.  i have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to properly represent originations on the ngp l.  i have learned how to prepare the benchmark.  i have reduced the time spent at night running the basis reports by consolidating the shankman fletch and lavorato reports into one file so that the information need only be queried once.  this was accomplished by creating multiple date bucket designations in a single file.  i updated the greg pos.  report so that it ties to the benchmark in total and reflects the lavorato time buckets.  i updated the gas detail tab of the benchmark to include new books that have been added to the benchmark.  this enabled me to tie the greg pos report to the benchmark.  i created an additional section of the gas detail tab to calculate the fixed price positions.  this section is used to report the total fixed price position by seasonal buckets on the lavorato basis report.  i have not included any from my former group.  if you would like to see them also please let me know. ,0,1,accomplishments

here is the draft letter agreement.  we are still discussing it with ecs and can make whatever changes are appropriate.  note that the letter agreement ties back to article 6 of the compression services agreement.  that article you may recall is where ecs agreed to create a computerized system that would monitor continental divide s electric system utilization and warn when their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor offline subject to manual override so we and ecs could avoid peak period demand charges.  instead of creating such a system which apparently turned out to be mostly a manual system anyway ecs is going to pay us a monthly fee to monitor cd s system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off line.  the load management service has to do with operational management of the load we place on cd s electric system and is not a jurisdictional gas transportation or storage service.  note that the service goes on for 10 years as required by the accountants 10 year amortization rule and thus may be vulnerable to scrutiny and potential revenue crediting in tw s 2007 rate case.  any way to avoid that df. ,2,0,tw letter agreement
cpuc votes to keep gas flowinga special session yesterday of california s regulators gave pg e s utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past feb.  7 when the current federal doe emergency order expires but it postponed action on another pg e request that southern california gas co.  which has strongly objected be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the pg e utility s residential and small business customers.  loretta lynch president of the california public utilities commission said pg e s utility is a victim a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers now demanding payment for future supplies up front not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills but because the electricity crisis has sapped its creditworthiness.  the cpuc action allows pg e s utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or in effect a lien in the utility s retail customers bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with pg e s gas utility operations while the creditworthiness of the company itself is dubious.  it won t be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts that it will know if the cpuc action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation according to pg e gas utility spokesperson staci homrig.  on the operational side pg e on wednesday declared a lowinventory ofo because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system.  the action was thought to help cause the pg e citygate price to jump from 11 to 17 on wednesday.  as for reports of low storage homrig said that while the utility s supplies are very low they are adequate for the next week.  they are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point homrig said.  lynch said that pg e has not defaulted on any payments but nevertheless in what she considers predatory practices the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided.  these gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh lynch said in voting for the securitization measure.  suppliers who have been paid when due are now saying regardless of existing agreements pay us today.  they are doing this in the coldest time of the year so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow pg e amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing.  part of the cpuc s action places a 90day limit on the securitization option so with the way gas contracts work in effect it only provides about another 30 days worth of supplies said homrig who noted that almost all of pg e s 25 to 30 suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements advances cashondelivery or letters of credit that the company cannot accommodate because of its cashflow crisis.  out of ongoing negotiations the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables thus assuring them they will get paid.  on the gas side pg e has had sufficient revenues unlike its electric business but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe creditrating decline in the past weeks.  the cpuc met in san francisco late wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor state legislature consumer groups regulators and utilities.  a key piece was missing however.  california state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis.  reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business.  a spokesman for the assembly speaker s office said he had no idea when the briefing would be rescheduled.  one piece of legislation that got through the state senate sb 1x yesterday authorizes another 500 million in emergency funds to purchase power.  it also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities wholesale power supplier under longterm contracts at least through 2002.  the measure drew a protest from cpuc commissioner richard bilas who argued that the state agency be removed from that role as quickly as possible.  the bill which was first passed by the state assembly was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate.  it then would have to be ratified again by the assembly.  meanwhile consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bailout of the privatesector utilities.  this prompted at least one of the utilities southern california edison to come out swinging saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any windfall profits or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company.  a letter surfaced in washington from gov.  gray davis to the senate energy and natural resources committee dated jan.  30 and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand sign longterm contracts and maintain the financial viability of the state s public utilities.  the letter a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here contained no specifics on any longterm contracts nor legislation signed that would address the immediate problem.  davis outlined measures being taken to speed up siting of new power plants saying an additional 2 000 mw would be online by the end of the year.  responding to questions on another arena edison international s senior vice president tom higgins said everything is on the table in the ongoing negotiations between davis threeperson negotiating team and the two utilities including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in los angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities own generation against the whopping wholesale power cost undercollections.  the state remained under a power watch for the 16th day as the california independent grid operator caliso urged conservation because reserves remain very low. ,0,1,daily california update.....

are we still considering adding ets owned generation at one or more of the tw compressor stations in arizona or nm in case that is still a possibility let me pass on something we may want to follow up on.  i called an old law partner of mine from dc who is now in the generation development business this week to have lunch and catch up.  this guy says he has come up with a good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap.  he s got an 80mw nameplate simple cycle project two frame 6 turbines under development in utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in service on july 1.  pretty quick work compared to other projects i ve seen.  here s his racket .  he gets used first quality turbines that have been well maintained.  his utah turbines are something like 2 year old ge units that he bought from tokyo electric he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in typical electric utility gold plated style .  he didn t say but i suspect there is no warranty on the units.  obviously this isn t a bold new strategy but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used equipment.  his siting permitting strategy is to use brownfield sites i. e.  existing industrial or utility infrastructure is there along with some existing air emissions sources.  his utah site is at the magnesium corp.  of ama plant on the great salt lake.  magcorp is an ex client of mine and i know it is a huge emissions source and has no nimby issues.  our compressor sites in contrast are not major emissions sites but may have some other things in common with this strategy.  here s a mysterious one he says the financing is backstopped by the site owner magcorp in his project potentially us if we do a tw project but the corporate structure he has designed results in the power plant being treated as a non controlled non affiliated entity for air permitting purposes.  that means the power plant emissions are not treated as part of the same emissions source as the host site.  i m not sure how whether this works in a tw scenario but it might be worth looking at.  we d need to make sure that any power plant deal we chase doesn t screw up the timetable on the redrock expansion application at ferc.  mkm if we could preserve the separate source concept for air permitting purposes could we even start work on developing a power project soon or would we be better off to wait until we have a ferc certificate in hand let me know if there is anything worth pursuing on this.  i m having lunch with this guy on mon.  and will probably learn more.  the thing he is proudest of is that given the low permitting cost and relatively cheap cost of installed capacity the project is expected to pay for itself in two months and then generate upside.  sounds good to me if its real.  df. ,0,1,tw generation

in the last several weeks several areas have come up where the commercial team could in my opinion use some clear written guidance on gray areas under the tariff ought to be interpreted.  here is my list.  please add items if i ve missed any.  when can selectively market available capacity i. e.  if capacity is on the board as available and no one has bought it are there any limits on calling up a customer or a group of customers and pitching a deal i think we have a lot of discretion here after all using the telephone to talk to one customer is always selective since there s only one guy on the phone not all our customers.  also can we deliberately leave a customer off the list of the usual suspects we call to pitch a special deal like an index to index deal or a discount i ve asked lee to pull together a quick analysis of this issue.  if we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open season context how do we allocate it this is the situation we got into a couple of weeks ago on the 02 and 03 space.  are we always required to use a lottery do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata or can we use pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance .  what approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate contracts the et s discount approval procedure still applies to discounted deals even there is no et s anymore .  i think all neg.  rate deals should be approved by law and regulatory but i don t need to see max rate strd language deals.  i think there was another issue but i can t remember what it was. ,0,-1,tw

i haven t done additional research but off the top of my head here s what i think.  open season giving all parties an equal shot to capacity is better than selective marketing.  however once capacity is posted a shipper is free to inquire about it and we should be free to solicit interest by picking up the phone.  i can research whether any pipeline got its hand slapped for selective marketing.  i thought we had agreed that we need a separate provision that governs the allocation of capacity on s system apart from rofr.  in the rewrite we should add language that allows us to use any nondiscriminatory allocation methodology as long as we give shippers advance notice by posting the methodology on our website.  until then section 13 of the fts1 rate schedule is the only guidance we have.  all available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures.  the lottery only comes into play if there are o bids of equal value.  i think we could use prorata as an allocation methodology if we notified all parties on the website ahead of time.  i agree with you on the approval process for negotiated rates and no or limited approval for standard language maxrate deals. ,0,-1,tw

i fielded a call today from mr.  rob cooper of u. s.  gypsum.  mr.  cooper indicated that he s been in contact with  for purposes of acquiring red rock expansion capacity.  moreover mr.  cooper has been in contact with socal gas in order that socal gas recognize firm deliveries from transwestern at needles in excess of the current sustainable limit of 750 mmcf d.  mr.  cooper insists that he is making progress with socal gas aimed at lifting the 750 window to 760 and that socal gas has indicated u. s.  gypsum would be entitled to an exclusive right to the increased amount.  while trying not to be argumentative i told mr.  cooper that if socal gas was willing to set aside a discrete increment of capacity for a single shipper it would be a radical departure from current socal gas policy.  currently socal gas does not provide unbundled intrastate transmission.  they have only accepted or not accepted pipeline nominations as the case may be as an aggregate volume with no distinction being drawn on who the upstream shippers were. i set about to try to explain that there is no correlation other than coincidental timing between 1 tw discussions with socal gas at raising the capacity window at needles and 2 tw s effort to sell red rock expansion space.  in addition i attempted to explain that tw feels it will be required to follow certain rules pursuant to its tariff and ferc policy associated with making new delivery point capacity available on a nondiscriminatory basis.  with respect to this issue i told mr.  cooper that although we re currently discussing it we d yet to come to any decision on how if incremental capacity does become available at needles tw would make such delivery point capacity available to its shippers.  mr.  cooper then proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how if that s the case then he s wasted 3 weeks in active negotiations with both socal gas and tw aimed at securing capacity at needles.  he said on several occasions that end game for him was to secure a firm portal from the interstate system onto and through the socal gas system.  mr.  cooper also expressed a concern that if he s forced into a competitive bidding situation with other big marketing companies in his words such as ena for needles capacity then he probably couldn t compete and once again would be left on the outside looking in.  he pointed to the el paso merchant deal on epng as a prime example.  mr.  cooper said he wasn t ready to accept my explanation as to why tw couldn t commit to offering u. s.  gypsum an exclusive right to any incremental needles capacity and asked that i formally run it up the flagpole to senior management and get back with him by telephone with tw s official position.  as an editorial comment i m not sure mr.  cooper completely understands or cares about the landscape here.  i d go so far as to say that from his style and the tone of his conversation with me he won t easily take no or even a maybe as an answer.  the difficulty for tw is going to be in trying to persuade him that we re interested in his business and sympathize with his position but that we face real legal and or regulatory issues here and they cannot be dismissed or ignored by u. s.  gypsum or any other customer. i d like to be in a position to call him back on friday and give him tw s official position on his request for needles service in the red rock expansion.  thoughts suggestions help. ,19,29,u.s. gypsum request for capacity
tino called this morning with a quick report.  they are still negotiating with doe on a power plant deal but it looks pretty shaky.  the size of the plant has grown to 380 mw for reasons that are unclear to me.  tino has been ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls apart.  he says dennis has about 3 mm in the project so far most of it related to the pipeline right of way.  the have a binding 20 year agreement with the tribes for the row that calls for a 100 000 minimum monthly payment.  i m not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the row agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  the question is whether we are even interested enough to justify a closer look since the rights dennis has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  i told tino i d give him a call next week to let him know.  at minimum i d suggest we have one of our row guys take a look at whatever they ve got and advise us on what its worth.  your thoughts df. ,0,-1,pueblo

great memo.  i m sure you guys are in the course of discussing these very issues but here s my two cents worth.  once we decide on an optimal forum the key step before filing a lawsuit is the assessment of our probability of success for different reasons than is usually the case.  we need to weigh the chances of a favorable judgment against against the probability and extent of collateral damage to our defense not just tw but all of gpg in quinque et al.  i like our case a lot based on what i ve seen so far if i ve got it right our claim is that breached the 1990 measurement agreement by not calibrating the meters as required and therefore by allowing the error to arise and remain uncorrected for so long.  under the nm statute we may get 6 years worth of recovery or more i guess if they did something to toll the sol .  under the texas sol maybe less.  do we have a good argument that the standard in the measurement agreement and the standard in s tariff do not absolve them of conversion or breach liability seems to me that will argue that the ferc tariff preempts our contract rights but i think the law is on our side there.  the tricky issue then becomes whether our prosecution of the claim against plays into the hands of our adversaries on the quinque mess.  if so how do we quantify that risk to allow a rational balancing of the pros and cons.  i m glad smart guys like you two will have to do that thinking.  as usual i ll try to stay on the sidelines and nod intelligently when you make a recommendation.  df. ,0,-1,el paso

i read wednesday s ngpl order rp00 18 002 as applying only to ngpl due to their unique restrictions and tariff rules.  i do not read it as forcing the rest of the industry i. e.  us to use the floor rate as the reserve price for negotiated index rate bids and ordinary recourse rate bids.  i think we can still determine the reserve price on a prearranged deal like the based on our good faith valuation of the upside provided by the index mechanism.  i. e.  on that type of deal we can determine that the index mechanism is worth x cents to us and require a discounted recourse rate bidder to bid more than the floor plus x cents to win.  agreed note that ngpl whined that the unique rules they are subject to place them at a competitve disadvantage to the rest of the industry i. e.  us on this issue.  the commission didn t say anything about that implying to me that the rest of us are still free to do what ngpl cannot do.  df. ,2,4,ena deal

attached is my redline of your sat.  draft.  in addition to the revisions in the doc i have a few questions and concerns .  on the segmenting section i think it is a fine legal argument but it lacks something.  what is our or else position does the global settlement give us any ferc out rights or colorable argument that the entire deal should be unwound if ferc screws up the segmenting issue i m not suggesting that we should trigger a ferc out if we have one but if we arguably do we should consider threatening to use it.  i m afraid we come across as whiny and ferc s position will likely be so what what are you going to do about it if we have no arguable ferc out and the only or else we have is that we ll take them to court and force them to adhere to the original deal i m for leaving the draft as is.  we can make our appeal threat more direct on rehearing if they hose us in the initial order.  on the arbitrage argument i ve taken out any reference to an example and softened the verbiage a bit.  i want to leave in the references to the arbitrage issue however because ferc understands the problem and believes it is widespread.  we don t need to prove exactly how big a problem it is on our system although it would have been very effective if we had clear facts .  do any of the oba changes arguably conflict with the global settlement if so we d better be prepared to eat our words from the segmenting section.  covering ourselves in the sanctity of that settlement in section 1 and then fiddling around with it in section 2 won t play well.  it is my understanding that the oba system on tw was not part of the turnback resolution deal so i hope this won t be a problem.  on fn 20 i d suggest we use vig s data and chart for may of 2000.  the arb opportunity is huge and clear.  we reference in the fn that we use all six of the gas daily price points and i think vig used just 3.  what s the right answer good work everyone please give it one more careful look on monday am and it should be good to go.  df  08 12 2000 08 33 am. ,12,15,tw's 637 filing

i got a call from tino monaldo today passing on the results of dennis langley s meeting with doe in albuquerque.  doe indicated that their current pnm rate is 5. 3 cents exclusive of the demand charge.  tino s consultant claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of approximately 7 cents kwh.  assuming we need to come in at less than the current rate our bogey is 6. 3 cents kwh.  this is at the high end of the range we hoped they d be in. additionally doe indicated that they need redundancy and don t want to rely on pnm for back up power.  they want a multiple turbine facility i. e.  more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines.  the new pipeline will need to be split connected to el paso and tw in order to access diverse supplies and guard against supply failure.  they have not asked for fuel oil backup.  i know this is starting to look like the project that won t go away but the power price number looks very promising to me.  i think its worth scrubbing down the model we ve used to replace the generic capital cost and o m assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine configuration we d be using.  if this price is really as favorable as i think can we make another run at the ena people and federal solutions guys to see if they have any interest df. ,9,-1,pueblo

on thursday last week the commission eliminated the old texas eastern rule that required pipelines to obtain prior ferc approval before contracting for transportation and storage capacity on upstream or downstream pipelines.  the new rule allows pipelines to acquire and use such capacity without going to ferc first.  the rule does reiterate that bundled sales of gas are still prohibited and further provides that the acquiring pipeline will be financially at risk for the costs of the acquired capacity.  interestingly the acquiring pipeline apparently has the option of selling the acquired capacity under its own rate schedules or of releasing the capacity pursuant to its capacity release program.  the order is silent on whether the price cap applies to short term releases of acquired capacity.  while we are still reviewing the order and may provide additional guidance at a later time i d emphasize for now that our normal contract approval procedures and authority thresholds should be deemed to apply to capacity contracts.  for example the approval authorization for cash expenditures dated feb.  3 2000 provides  and steve with authority up to 250 000 on operating expense obligations.  please contact me if you have any questions on this matter.  df. ,3,0,upstream capacity

i just talked to tino monaldo dennis langley s lawyer project manager for the project.  i explained  and  s credentials and concerns and tino suggested that a sit down between enron and their government contracts team might be helpful.  he offered to do it in houston probably late next week or the following week.  attending would be dennis tino and their outside lawyers jim slattery and rick harrington.  harrington is the key he is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt.  contracts lawyers at my old firm in dc.  the would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all through their sole source strategy including their legal interpretations and the allies they have lined up within doe dod.   and  does such a meeting sound productive if so should we have outside govt.  contracts counsel present and if so who do you suggest on a related note tino explained without me asking or really caring that he was in the middle of a big drafting project revising dennis joint venture agreement with the isleta.  i took the opportunity to express my concern at how far down the road dennis is getting on the overall deal including structure issues without knowing whether enron is even on board.  i reminded tino that gpg has not committed to participating in the pipeline or the power plant and that we have not obtained ena s agreement to commit turbines.  apparently dennis believes that if the economics pans out enron or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with money turbines etc.  if enron does eventually decide to get into this deal the agreements and promises that dennis has already made may need to be revisited. ,0,-1,pueblo

tino called today to report on their meetings with doe last week.  tino dennis langley and their outside lawyer jim slattery met with bill richardson and doe staff to discuss the sole source procurement approach to doe s obtaining an alternative power supplier for kirtland afb and sandia.  tino reports that richardson signed off on the sole source approach subject only to doe review of the final contract to assure its consistency with the public interest.  tino believes that the combination of significant native american involvement in the overall deal structure along with a power price that is lower than doe s current pnm rates will satisfy the public interest standard.  slattery is set to begin discussions with doe next week on the overall structure of dennis proposal.  i am surprised that dennis would go this far before hearing from us on the economics but tino made it sound like the initial discussions would be fairly general i. e.  to explain to doe that the plan is to build a new pipeline and a new power plant and to do the whole thing in partnership with the isleta tribe but without talking about specific economic issues.  sounds to me like dennis has richardson on board but is nevertheless planning to pitch to the lower level doe staff people what a great deal this is for the tribes and therefore the government.  tino not surprisingly is eager to see numbers and sit down to discuss them.  he suggested a meeting the first week of may in either houston or kc.  i asked tino whether he could get firmer numbers from doe than we currently have on 1 total electric and gas load current and projected for the afb and sandia and 2 actual price doe currently pays for gas and power.  he didn t think he could get better information before the first week in may.  on another related topic through shelley corman s group i got acquainted with a guy named tim beldon who runs the ena transmission capacity book for the western u. s.  out of portland.  i talked with him for a few minutes about power flows and pricing in the n. m arizona area and he seemed pretty knowledgable.  he has a transmission engineer on his team who is an expert in verifying utility claims of transmission constraints.  apparently ena buys and sells a lot of power in the four corners area and is pretty familiar with the transmission availabilty and power pricing situation up there.  i didn t discuss with tim the specifics of the project we are looking at but did tell him that  and steve were looking at a potential power plant load and trying to figure out how serious it is.   if you guys think beldon could provide useful info on the cost and availability of firm and non firm transmission for the surplus power out of albequerque up to four corners please give him a call.  it is ok to disclose to beldon what we are working on but please inform him that we are subject to a confidentiality agreement and that further disclosure is improper.  please let me know whether a meeting with these guys the first week of may is doable. ,6,13,pueblo

given the numbers we got from mark baldwin is this where we are .  the overall economics of the pipeline project have to be supported almost entirely by the new power plant.  at most we could assume maybe 5 000 10 000 day of gas load from industrials near the airport and another x 000 from kirtland s gas load.  this assumed load will ramp up over several years or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are and not be available immediately.  we know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for doe.  its probably 0. 042 kwh less 15 to make it attractive or maybe 0. 056 less 15 .  either way a low rate.  we now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipeline about 17 mm in the 16 configuration without the isleta lateral or the lateral over to the power plant.  maybe about 20mm total .  we don t have absolutely reliable info on electric transmission constraints from the proposed plant to palo verde so i d suggest that for now we just assume that we would be unconstrained on power sales at palo verde.  are there alternative liquid markets available that might have better pricing ercot pub.  serv.  colorado .  i m not entirely sure how you guys are looking at the overall economics but to my non business guy mind the following scenarios or something similar stick out as the key benchmarks that will decide whether the project makes sense a.  worst case assume we build a 75 mw power plant i. e.  assume no extra power to sell in spot market and assume we get the kirtland gas load but no additional gas load from the customers baldwin talked to .  if the rate for the gas line is the minimum rate that enron could live with based on our internal hurdle rates can we hit the doe target power price and have any left over i suspect this scenario is upside down.  should we look at two alternative configurations for the power plant combined cycle and simple cycle b.  mid case assume we size the power plant at 150mw or some similar size based on a turbine configuration that makes sense and that we sell the surplus power at palo verde prices less albequerque palo verde transmission costs.  again assume no incremental gas load except kirtland.  if the gas pipeline rate is set at the minimum rate enron can live with does the power plant make enough to make the project work c.  wildly optimistic case same as mid case except add baldwin s gas load and start ramping in some estimated amount of additional gas load when nm gas restructuring kicks in in 2003 did i get the year right .  also start ramping in some estimated amount of high priced retail power sales to back out the palo verde spot sales at whatever year nm retail electric restructuring is expected to kick in.  also 2003 i think .  with optimistic assumptions like this does it make sense tino suggested a meeting to talk economics in detail around the first of may.  ideally we ll have a feel for the above relationships and the transmission constraint situation by then. ,17,20,pueblo

some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue i. e.  are we cutting off shippers supply due to force majeure .  if the gas at the point is out of spec on water the answer is clearly no.  we re shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the tariff quality spec.  not due to force majeure.  we have the discretion to grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent operators and so long as we don t discriminate.  if that gas is out of spec on any of the specific items listed in the quality section of the tariff sec.  44 47 i can t remember which but its one of those then the answer is the same.  if the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons i think the answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons falling out as liquids.  i m remembering the catch all section of the quality paragraph as prohibiting dirt gums and other impurities that would interfere with the operation of compressors blah blah or something to that effect.  that catch all seems to me to include liquids.  if the c6 and heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids then the people delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas therefore no force majeure.  i read eric s very scientific email and i think the punch line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids right the thing i can t remember is whether the quality section has specific max.  limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  if so and if the shippers are within those limits my theory based on the catch all language doesn t work as good.  if we think we need to claim force majeure we have a problem because we could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  generally an event isn t force majeure if it is purely economic. i ll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  df. ,0,-1,fm

speak of the devil.  tino called all full of optimism and questions.  they have pitched the doe a deal in which dennis builds three 50 mw turbines on the isleta and a 7 mile power line to doe s distribution lines.  the project will apparently be debt financed with doe agreeing to pay a firm demand charge rate of between 8 and 9 cents kwh.  that rate is supposedly high enough to service the debt on a 10 year amort.  basis remember doe can only sign 10 year contracts .  doe is interested says tino because of the redundant dedicated facilities and enhanced reliability and because dennis and tino pitched doe on all the doe will make from the surplus power sales.  dennis apparently pitched them a share the upside deal under which doe keeps most of the revenue from surplus sales.  tino showed doe the july spot prices at 4 corners which tino said included many days over 200 mwh and they got all excited.  doe has done a similar share the upside deal at one of its facilities in calif.  tino says and they have occasionally come out net positive on elec.  costs in some months so they like the approach.  tino had two questions .  does tw have 30 40 000 d of permian capacity available starting sometime in 2001 or 2002 i realize we have probably answered this question about 5 times but lets do it again for him .  is there someone at ena tino can talk to about a getting a quote for long term and or short term power purchase prices for four corners delivery if he can get something the doe thinks is a good price they m ay just sell all the surplus power forward.  if not they ll just hang on to it and sell it into the cash market in monthly and daily deals. ,0,-1,pueblo

i agree with your concern but i ve gotten comfortable that the pleading does a good job of finessing the issue.  technically you are right and pnm s service is neither firm or interruptible.  it is my understanding that pnm assigns priority based on a number of factors including whether the customer is a core customer or not et cet.  i think that pnm is capable of determining on a contract by contract basis whether the capacity will be firm even though the rate schedule may not say firm.  explaining all that complexity would make it unlikely that ferc would approve the rehearing.  nevertheless i believe its accurate to say that we will only repackage as firm service the capacity that we buy from pnm and that they tell us is firm.  i think the draft does that without going throught the unhelpful detail on how pnm handles its own priority system.  if i misunderstand the facts or if anyone disagrees with this approach lets talk about it.  df. ,4,-1,rp00-249 rehearing request

funny for immediate release today enron and hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said to be worth an estimated 666 trillion.  in the deal enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to hades facilities throughout and under north america.  john d.  rockefeller former ceo of energy monopolist standard oil is now head of hades energy management division.  said rockefeller obviously hell has significant heating demands.  while eternal flames are a great idea in concept they require vast and reliable fuel resources.  enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my boss and as a former monopolist i just like the way they do business.  a spokesperson for enron said the two cultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  according to the company the deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  with hades ability to attract and retain new customers we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to come.  according to several energy industry insiders hades high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.  hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and approximately 173 quintillion customers.  the entity boasts sustained high growth rates over the last two thousand years.  enron is one of the world s leading energy and communications companies.  the company owns approximately 37 billion in energy and communications assets.  enron ranks in the top quarter of fortune s best 100 companies to work for if you can keep a job there and don t mind working 80 hours a week and is among the most respected corporations in america as ranked by customers with respect us or get curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts. ,0,-1,it could happen

one additional point.  if we aren t going to try to rebut the funny money argument on the merits can we at least have leslie lawner or someone loaded up to dispute their circumstantial case both amoco and dynegy argue that marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their sister pipelines than they do on non affiliated pipes.  they argue that unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone.  the enron pipes may be a statistical oddity on this.  a very small percentage of nn and tw capacity has been held by affiliates.  i think the same is true on border and to a lesser extent on florida.  amoco and dynegy can t have it both ways.  if they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe s capacity being held by marketing affiliates i. e.  el paso then they also have to infer an absence of abuse from a small percentage i. e.  the enron pipes .  can we argue this df  01 19 2001 09 32 am. ,1,7,update on marketing affiliate conference

this is the issue i left you the voice mail on.  article 6 of the gallup compression services agreement which i am sending to you separately with ecs obligates ecs to work in good faith with cdec to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on cdec s system.  we had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ecs would not be able to complete that by the contract start date so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ecs is obligated to assist transwestern in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep transwestern whole for all cost and expenses associated with the manual system.  we will fight with them about who owes the 200k that  mentions below based on their failure to assist us in managing the cost.  in the mean time we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.  do we have someone who is watching this out there we are running so full tilt on tw that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected but let me know what we can do.   had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement i guess between ecs and transwestern that would permit ecs to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info.  from cdec.  that sounds like a bs excuse from ecs but it that s what they are saying let me know and we can figure out a solution. ,1,-1,gallup rebate

i reviewed the latest draft of aa s management rep.  letter and caught a few innaccuracies in the way aa described the deal.  i attach a revised draft of the letter with a redline version to highlight for you the changes i think we need to make to keep it accurate.  first aa only listed two of the four agreements that comprise the deal.  they apparently forgot that we had created a second sba.  additionally at transcanada s request we put the transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year.  you will recall that last year sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the sba.  second aa s bullet no.  4 as originally drafted states that northern does not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term of the agreement.  that statement is confusing given that article vi. of the monthly pack agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is a form of purchase option.  that cash out mechanism was in kent s bullets describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that aa looked at so i assume they are ok with the mechanism and were just inartful in drafting bullet no.  my simple fix was to leave aa s language alone but to add an except for reference at the beginning of bullet no.  third aa s draft of bullet nos.  5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous references to other agreements and additional agreements respectively.  since aa s list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete these references in bullet nos.  5 and 6 were also innacurate.  now that i have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete i ve clarified the bullets by adding the other than those agreements referenced above language to both bullets.  the couple of other changes in bullet 5 simply clarify the meaning.  finally i ve modified the signature blocks per conversation with bill to delete mkm and myself.  i am certainly willing and able to sign this letter but mkm is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements.  getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time.  additionally bill s thought was that mkm and i are his direct reports anyway so it doesn t serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the top guy has signed.  please give me a call if you have any questions or want to discuss these matters. ,0,1,mgt. rep. letter

midam advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline probably today to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the carlton timing problem . e.  the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement .  if midam does so enforcement will then contact northern for a response probably  or mkm or i but who knows who they ll call. if they do the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary response to midam .  midam and all of our customers are aware that a commission order on the june 2 2000 settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for this nov march period can be determined.  the flow obligation for sourcers like midam will be slightly higher by about if the settlement is approved.  for all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation numbers would be under the two scenarios settlement approval or settlement non approval we have given that information.  we gave that information to midam also.  we can t file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number for this heating season until the commission addresses the settlement.  the true financial impact of the current uncertainty on midam is minimal.  we believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based on the lower flow obligation number but with an option to increase their purchase quantity if the commission approves the settlement.  midam may have done that but we don t know.  if not and if the commission approves the settlement their only real cost would arise if they have to buy the additional flow obligation volume about 1100 mmbtu d for midam now at a higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply.  given the large drop in gas prices the last several days there may not be any increased cost.  the bottom line is that we really need an order on the settlement.  the majority of northern s customers support it as a fair solution to the carlton problem.  midam is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues.  midam is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old carlton mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving that windfall.  that s the end of the proposed script.  the last bullet may go to far but i like it.   and  mkm suggested that you guys get doering and gorak and others to call ferc hotline or otherwise i don t think it matters and express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.  df. ,0,3,enforcement call

there was a lengthy status conference this afternoon lasting about an hourand a quarter.  it was marred by extremely poor telephone connections.  thetechnical difficulties frustrated the parties and the judge and made theconference a mess. without trying to summarize the conference i note a few things that thecourt decided to do based on the discussions.  quinque.  judge downes agreed to have oral argument on the motion toremand in quinque on january 3 2001 at 1 15 p. m.  in casper.  one hour wasset aside for argument.  he declined mike beatty s suggestion of anadditional executive summary of the briefing.  the judge was the first oneto suggest the oral argument.  the plaintiffs suggested that the court ruleon the papers but quickly acquiesced to the court s suggestion when thedefendants said that they wanted argument.  osterhoudt.  osterhoudt appeared pro se.  motion to disqualifywright s counsel phillips cohen and estopping mr.  wright on some claims. both osterhoudt and wright want oral argument.  wright defendants and dojdidn t object.  osterhoudt was appearing pro se and so there was a longrambling discussion of the matter.  the judge was reluctant to cut off a prose party but ultimately did.  regrettably the rambling discussion set thetone for the rest of the call.  osterhoudt.  government s motion to dismiss ousterhoudt s case. government wants its motion to dismiss grynberg s valuation claims to beheard at the same time.  the government claims these relator status issuesare holding up the shell 56 million settlement and any future settlements. grynberg objected to having the motion in grynberg heard at the same time. grynberg wants discovery from wright and the government.  pending motions.  the court of out frustration at the inability tohear the parties and at the attempts by some to argue the merits of thingsthat the court was not prepared to address set down two hours for oralargument on february 22 2001 at 10 00 a. m.  on all pending motions inwright and grynberg that address the jurisdictional issues discussed on thecall and the motions to dismiss.  this obviously will create some problems. it was far from clear precisely which motions that the court had in mind. while there are not that many motions pending some of the pendinggovernment motions likely could affect public disclosure original sourcemotions that the defendants could but have not yet filed.  the defendantshave not filed those motions yet because of a desire to first test thecomplaints on rule 9 b grounds.  discovery.  parties who want discovery on those issues grynberg andprobably the wright defendants were given one day to present their positionby letter to the court.  other parties then will have two days to respond.  liaison counsel.  the court designated tom nicholas as liaisoncounsel for the defendants in the wright case and don schultz as liaisoncounsel for the defendants in the quinque case.  february 22 hearing.  phil figa one of grynberg s lawyers was giventhe task of leading the consultation among counsel concerning how thepending motions should be addressed at the hearing and how the time shouldbe divided. charles d.  tetraultvinson elkins l. l. p. 1455 pennsylvania ave.  n. w. washington d. c.  200041008 velaw. com202. 6551 voice 202. 6604 fax confidentiality notice the information in this email may be confidential and or privileged.  thisemail is intended to be reviewed by only the individual or organizationnamed above.  if you are not the intended recipient or an authorizedrepresentative of the intended recipient you are hereby notified that anyreview dissemination or copying of this email and its attachments if any or the information contained herein is prohibited.  if you have receivedthis email in error please immediately notify the sender by return emailand delete this email from your system.  thank you. ,0,5,status conference before judge downes
the whole thing also bugs me on an intuitive level but i m not sure it is a legal conflict of interest.  the northern cases he is involved in are not really gisb matters.  there are certainly issues like the 637 compliance issue that involve gisb standards however.  gisb is a freestanding entitity and his representation does not equate to representation of enron so he could claim that his only client interest to worry about is gisb itself.  as long as he does not take positions in northern cases that are inconsistent with what gisb wants he s technically ok.  i suspect he d argue that his work in the northern docket is completely consistent with gisb s objective of achieving world domination.  this was my from the hip analysis when jay first showed up in our cases so i may have missed something.  for example i m not really clear on gisb s structure.  can we argue that it is not a real stand alone entity but rather a front for a cooperative group of companies that includes enron if so we might have a real conflict. ,0,-1,supplemental ndg comments in rm98-10

here s the latest tino gram .  tino s environ.  consultants have not discovered any stop signs.  the isleta is interested in granting dennis row lease for the power plant as well as the pipeline.  the power plant could be located on isleta land adjacent to the south boundary of the scandia reservation.  thus the power plant could be connected to doe s existing powerline infrastructure without ever leaving the isleta and doe land.  pnm would not be necessary to move power to doe.  unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power.  maybe this could be done through doe to an interconnect with pnm on the scandia reservation .  dennis is using jim slattery an ex law partner of mine in dc and ex dem.  u. s.  congressman from kansas as his primary contact with bill richardson at doe.  my recollection is that jim does have a good relationship with richardson so this seems very likely to be effective.  tino reports that doe is ok with the deal and the next step is negotiating the power contract itself.  tino said that doe is aware that the capital for the project will not come from the tribe so the tribe s interest will be fairly thin.  it is unclear exactly how much indian ownership dennis and slattery promised doe.  tino has run into a power plant consultant named jack maddox who says he s working on a 230mw plant to be located west of belen.  tino thinks he s working for the laguna tribe but wanted us to find out who is planning a big power plant out there.  is this ours pnm s el paso finally the next key step is obviously the economics.  based on what tino told me i m convinced that dennis and tino don t have a real good sense of how much might be in this deal.  they are groping a bit and our initial analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight.  how are those efforts coming. ,0,-1,confidential

i note in tw s bullets for 12 22 that tw did the cal border backhaul deal with sw gas.  the last i heard about it the deal had cratered.  i had serious reservations about doing the deal as it was initially described to me which included a cal border sale of surplus gas and a backhaul for ees on behalf of sw gas.  my probems were 1 the issue of possible or apparent affiliate preference and 2 the need for adequate documentation of surplus line pack.  my last guidance was that a deal like this might be doable but only if we could document the surplus and if stan signed off on it.  what happened does the deal involve ees was that raised with stan and danny the bullets don t mention the identity of the shipper that the backhaul was done for.  please respond.  df. ,0,2,tw backhaul

steve filled in the detail for me on the mentioned in the law bullets this morning.  a valve was left open between an lg e facility and northern for an approximate 3 month period i m not sure how recent .  lg e s gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into northern was approx.  180 000 mmbtu with a value of about 500 000.   and steve have talked to lg e and it does not appear that we have any good arguments for avoiding the liability.  the unexpected and unmetered deliveries from lg e presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance during the referenced 3 month period.  accordingly i assume the cost of replacing that gas should be accounted for in northern s pra and so should not affect earnings.  i m not sure what the timetable is for resolving this matter.  df. ,1,2,lg&e issue

great looks like a good start at working through this project.  i ve got a couple of thoughts questions etc.  that i d like to discuss with you all before we get back to tino with any kind of preliminary response .  what is our pulse on a project that ramps up slowly to full utilization this deal will not be subscribed for several years optimistically as it is designed to gain market share from a combination of market growth and bypass of existing gcnm customers and new power generation load but that part of tino s story needs more thinking .  the rates on the attached spreadsheet would provide full cost recovery only after the project is fully subscribed right we need to think about the economics of this thing in terms of deferring and recovering in the out years the revenue shortfalls in the early years.  has gpg ever done deals like that .  on the gcnm discounting issue it seems we need at least three data points to understand our risks a.  what do gcnm s current discounts look like b.  how much more aggressively could gcnm discount in the future if they had to to avoid bypass i. e.  are there regulatory or political constraints on increased discounts c.  will the big industrial loads stick with the low cost provider if gcnm tries to undercut the project or will they be willing to pay a little more just to assure that a new pipeline gets built into their backyard .  assuming we don t have the risk appetite to get in on a project like this how do we positiion ourselves to be the preferred upstream pipeline for langley s project i assume that if neither tw nor el paso partner with langley he ll interconnect with both.  do we already have or can we create any kind of competitive advantage under that scenario .  is the right of way that langley has negotiated really all that valuable from  s memo it seems that the issue of which route is best is half baked at best.  if that s all dennis brings to the table not counting his big bag of does a deal with him really make sense i m sure there are a lot of other issues we need to discuss but these are the first that come to mind.  please give me a call when you get together to discuss this as i d like to be involved in how we respond to tino and dennis. ,12,0,albuquerque project bullets

another tino gram.  doe disclosed to team tino that they pay a 7. 06 mo demand charge per kw in addition to the . 053 kwh energy charge.  tino didn t know whether that was per kw of monthly demand per kw of non coincident peak usage or what.  the pnm tariff for govt.  service is priced at 7. 16 kw of demand above 10 000kw during peak period peak period is daytime so i assume that is how it is calculated.  if that is the tariff schedule 4000b under which doe really takes service this is interesting because that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate.  it is also interesting that doe is paying . 053 kwh for energy since the schedule 4000b energy rate is . 05072 kwh maybe the difference is surcharges or something .  tino s consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an incremental . 011 in addition to the . 053 kwh energy charge for a total delivered pnm rate to doe of . 064 kwh.  this is not as good as the 7 cent number tino threw around earlier in the week but its still not terrible.  if the bogey is a reduction to the current rate our number to beat is . 0576 kwh.  tino promised us copies of doe s actual energy bills to confirm these numbers.  that would be great and solves the due diligence problem you and i talked about yesterday .  tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the isleta s consultant that the cobisa belen project is dead.  do we know anything about this interesting.  i m waiting to hear back from bill votaw to line up a due diligence call to tino s government contracts lawyers in dc to confirm whether the sole source strategy is legit.   i ll let you know when this is scheduled in case you want to be on the call. ,0,-1,pueblo
al thirdparty subpoenasmike and andy andy i tried to send this message to richard as well but the computer directory is fouled up and won t let me do it.  i hope sending it to you is sufficient but if not let me know. i received a call from mike noone of mike beatty associates about the abovereferenced lawsuit which is filed in state court in garfield county colorado.  for andy s reference beatty associates is representing the enron entities and a number of other defendants in the grynberg mdl case.  this case is not a gas measurement case which is the gist of the grynberg action. noone s firm represents the plaintiff i did not ask who represents the defendants all of whom are questar entities.  the lawsuit arises out of a partnerhip agreement to build the transcolorado pipeline.  the transcolorado pipeline takes gas from colorado producers at its northern end to an interconnect or interconnects at its southern end to either el paso or tw who deliver the gas to california markets.  after it was built questar allegedly began building a competing pipeline called the main line 104 project the designation used in the ferc filings which will connect questar s gathering system at the northern end of the pipeline to the kern river pipeline.  kern river will apparently ultimately deliver the gas to california markets.  kn contends that the main line 104 project will take gas from exactly the same basins as the transcolorado pipeline the picence and ulenta basins if i have that spelled correctly and is in direct competition.  i did not ask mike what relief kn is requesting. kn is interested in documentation from tw and ena that discusses what their competitive options are in getting gas from the area served by the transcolorado pipeline to california markets.  it appears that kn is hoping to see some discussion of the main line 104 project as an alternative to the transcolorado pipeline.  it strikes me that such information may be highly sensitive. i asked mike why he thought ena would have any such information and mike said that he thought ena might own or have an interest in some producing properties in the relevant area.  i told mike that that would be a surprise to me and that eog which is the enron entity that typically owns such interests was spun off last year.  mike said he would take another look to see why they thought ena would have such information. the trial date is one year out and this is apparently the first round of discovery.  mike would not be surprised if we got a call from questar s attorneys requesting the same information. noone faxed to me the proposed subpoenas with the understanding that i was not authorized to accept service for them.  i will send copies to each of you.  let me know if you would like the unit to handle or assist in the handling of this. ,7,8,"new matter/kn transcolorado, inc. v. questar corporation, et "

per louie soldano i called dave sinclair gpg row about whether we have any ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the railroad.  in dave s experience that is a nonstarter.  apparently a bunch of utilities including us through dave have even formed a coalition to try to figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative.  if the rr owns its row outright which many of the old railroads do out west we might be able to condemn an easement by getting a ferc certificate.  in other words the rr would be treated just like any other landowner.  if we did that dave thinks would treat it as a declaration of war.  since our lines cross or parallel right of way all over the place from topock to duluth that would be foolish.  i swore sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world i was interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private row without too much pain.  if the rr option doesn t pan out we may want to suggest to tino and dennis that our row people can handle this.  assuming we can t come up with some magic contact with the rr i propose that at the appropriate time we tell dennis and tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of row should be flagged as a potential problem that enron can help resolve once we decide to go forward.  other than the issue i don t think we have any specific to dos or any specific comeback date to dennis and tino.  so what do you guys think should happen next df. ,0,-1,bnsf

there were several questions left for legal regulatory to work on at the close of our meeting today.  i ll try to restate them and add my initial thoughts so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  q 1.  can tw use negotiated rate agreements for its new 150 mm d expansion .  yes.  independence guardian and other new pipeline projects were certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  the only restriction is that we need to always offer cost based recourse rate service as an alternative to negotiated rates.  we hope to use negotiated rate agreements for the entire 150 mm of capacity but we won t know until the contracts are executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it will be under recourse rate contracts.  i guess that means that in the cert.  app.  we just tell the commission that we will be at risk and that given the huge interest in the open season we have no doubts about our ability to sell the full 150.  we should also tell the commission we expect to sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a combination of both.  q 2.  can we give prospective customers a cafeteria style menu of options to steal jeff s term like the following 1.  5 yr.  neg.  rate deal at a locked in . 60 plus fuel and surcharges or whatever number we decide on 2.  10 y.  neg.  rate deal at a locked in . 45 plus fuel and surcharges 3.  15 yr.  neg rate deal at a locked in . 35 blah blah 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges importantly this option is not locked in and will float with tw s actual rate levels and fuel retainage percentages .  i think the answer here is yes.  whatever options we come up with for 1 2 and 3 we will always have to offer 4 as well.   and steve. ,3,25,tw expansion

professor  i would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the mba program.  in the end the results were not favorable.  i understand that it is a competitive process but i felt that with my work experiences recommendations extrcurricular activities etc.  that this would help my chances and possibly compensate my disability.  after talking with you and professors ronn brown and jemison i was sure that ut was the right place to continue learning about energy finance.  i am still sure that ut is the place for getting an excellent graduate level education so i want you to know that i am going to do what ever it takes to get in next year.  i plan on taking a couple of graduate level finance courses at the university of houston this summer and fall to demonstrate to the admissions office that i can compete at this level.  i also plan on trying to retake the gmat test.  due to my disability this will be a monumental task but i am determined to prove to the admissions committment that i can do the work at the texas university graduate school of business.  also i would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an energy finance private equity fund at ut.  i know that with my industry wide and investment banking contacts that i can help raise capital for the fund.  i am very interested in energy finance and think that your idea is a very good. ,1,-1,results!

us gasliquidityeol has allowed enron to simultaneously provide internal and external customers with realtime markets in many o the physical and inancial products that we trade.  the ability o all customers to execute trades and receive instantaneous conimations has resulted in rapidly growing volumes and growing customer participation.  one o the beneits o this system is to allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being unnelled through third party brokers.  enron has committed to providing both depth o volume and tight bid oer spreads.  this committment has been main driver o the growth in volume since rollout last nov. transparencythe existence o our two way market has removed all doubt about the irmness o bids and oers.  we will trade on the price and volume on our bid and oer.  the growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on the sometimes unreliable broker served market.  many o our customers and competitors now use eol as an inormation source as well as a trading vehicle.  eol is the only service that provides ree real time inormation on as many traded markets in the physical and inancial worlds.  we have no competition in this regard.  this aspect o eol has been helpul to the smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.  deal lowas the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading beneits.  we are collecting the bid oer spread on our transactions and over time this results in a direct bottom line beneit.  enron s market share o inancial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market. ,0,8,user testimonial from the uk power desk

the main issue that i see with the description you sent me is the same one that we spoke about a ew weeks ago.  what should the consistent et convention or determining the irst tranaction be i we use the current ng trading convention we will quote the premium swap as the irst transaction and the discount as the second.  this will present consistency problems i we are trading near parity in the calendar with dierent months changing position in the curve.  you just have to look at some o the summer spreads to see the conusion that may result.  having the near dated swap as the irst transaction in all cases would eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.  i will check with john to see i he has any opinion on the matter.  the product description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily be able to determine the correct direction to trade.  i will discuss this and the entire description with john on tues.  and get back to you . ,1,4,double transaction calendar spread swap

great to hear from you.  looking forward to meeting in houston for a baseball game. conway will be in corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  we should startconstruction on the house in may what an incredibly long process it is.  i definitely wouldnot do it if i had to do it over again.  one redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block.  we definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  we should get a pop in realestate also when all the california companies start migrating to texas.  joking aside unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined witha lot of rainfall you re summer will suck.  there is no doubt that the ca economy is goingto suffer a great recession.  you have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease theproblem is to reduce demand.  this usually occurs when prices reach levels where the pricesensitive buyers cut back.  however with your boy grey davis pushing for price caps this won thappen.  the next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave so this will probablyneed to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  the other factor of course is that youcould have an increase in supply new power plants.  but being that the amt.  of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in ca is about 3 times as long as in most other states combinedwith the fact that ca hasn t had a new power plant in the last 10 years an increase in supplydoesn t seem likely in the short term.  again this is only my opinion so you could take it witha grain of salt.  talk to you soon. ,2,-1,portable generator

the house thing is a tough call.  it s hard to say.  if you re not in any hurry to buy the summer should giveyou a good indication of continuing energy problems.  i personally think that the problem will come and go for a while but a lot depends on how california s legislature deals with the situation.  i have no idea what they ll end up doing they ve acted pretty poorly already. what s your time frame on a house if you re only concern is that prices are at their highest level in the last decade i wouldn t worry too much about that.  it s impossible to time the market who would ve thought san francisco s housing prices would be at these current levels.  there are also a lot of intangibles associated with home ownership as your aware of.  i would be concerned about the energy situation so just try to keep abreast of it.  also you could call me if youhave any questions.  i ll try to help the best i can.  take care and tell kim and kendall i said hi.  aol. on 01 22 2001 10 48 39 pm. ,0,11,everythings big in texas?

stamos i don t think many buying opportunities out there.  the economy is going to get crushed this year.  there s only one place to put one s money now and that is in cash. the manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase inplant shutdowns and company layoffs.  the fed could continue to lower rates but there llbe little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  i feel we ve just seen the beginning.  i think the dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of april. psychologically the california crisis will add to consumer fear.  the crisis is not a short termproblem.  as a result barring any federal bailout you could kiss that state s economy goodbye. let me ask you a question if you were paying 1 the highest real estate prices in the country and .  the highest energy prices for the least reliable power in 3 the midst of a hi tech meltdown what wouldkeep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state if you own anyca real estate sell.  the only way to solve the ca energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply. since ca doesn t want any power plants in its backyard the supply issue likely won t be solved anytimesoon.  so how do impact demand you have to price energy power gas so high thatthe discretionary user household manufacturer commercial store conserves by closing its plant cuttingback on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off peak hours.  california will seethis reduction in demand over time.  if the blackouts subside it s because so many businesses haveclosed their doors for good or moved to another state.  without this the blackouts will get much worse. if the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas i would bet it will gobankrupt within 2 3 yrs.  could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the u. s.  s most prosperous state.  obviously this is only my opinion but i would keep my eyes onthe energy markets that s where the key to the turnaround lies.  take care and. ,0,16,good buying opportunity????

a much better note in bottle thrown out to sea i didn t actually write all this mushy stuff.  someone sent it to me.  it hurts to love someone and not be loved in return but what is more painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let that person know how you feel.  maybe god wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person we will know how to begrateful for that gift.  love is when you take away the feeling the passion and the romance in a relationship and find out you still care for that person.  a sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go.  the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with never say a word and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you ve ever had.  it s true the we don t know what we ve got until we lose it but it s also true that we don t know what we ve been missing until it arrives.  giving someone all your love is never assurance that they ll love you back don t expect love in return just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn t be content it grew in yours.  there are things you d love to hear that you would never hear from the person whom you would like to hear them from but don t be so deaf as not to hear it from the one who says it from his heart.  never say good bye if you still want to try never give up if you still feel you can go on never say you don t love a person anymore if you can t let go love comes to those who still hope although they ve been disappointed there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real hope you dream of that special someone.  dream what you want to dream go where you want to go be what you want to be because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.  always put yourself in others shoes.  if you feel that it hurts you it probably hurts the person too.  a careless word may kindle strife a cruel word may wreck a life a timely word may level stress a loving word may heal and bless.  the happiest of people don t necessarily have the best of everything they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.  happiness lies for those who cry those who hurt those who have searched and those who have tried for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.  love begins with a smile grows with a kiss and ends with a tear the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past you can t go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.  when you were born you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.  live your life so that when you die you re the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying. ,8,10,love and life

responses .  i ll let  answer this one.  anr and michcon are central desk pipes.  i would prefer to address all items on exhibit 1.  if possible i would like to see the original exhibit 1 volumes and updated exhibit 1 volumes through march 2001.  however i don t remember buying back any baseload gas on tco for april.  i thought we priced everything at fom if and every day we are buying back gas at gd .  are you doing a buy sell with erron at the same price does duke bill ces directly for this .  see attached worksheets.  i don t know all the information on the local production yet.  the pricing i m currently using is the exhibit 1 fom deliverd pricing pricing using ena transport .  the attached april file has a local production tab.  molly johnson is updating this information.  after she completes april she will recreate jan mar.  since the delivered pricing on tco is the same i m not concerned about the individual citygate volumes.  for pricing purposes i only care about total daily deliveries.  it would be a problem if you were trying to take additional gas from a non constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and you don t have enough capacity.  this holds true for most other pipelines as well tenn z6 cng north citygate cng south citygate .  this would be a better question for charlie to ask me when he is looking for something specific as it comes up.  the only thing i will not allow you to do is take gas from one pipeline to the other texas gas z4 to cgas and colleen has discussed this with melissa.  columbiaenergygroup. on 04 18 2000 09 40 36 am. ,18,-1,questions

unless i m missing something it does not appear that there is a way for us to run a cpr report that shows all business done on a particular pipe regardless of desks.  for example if i want to see all business that is being done on transco i must run the report for both the northeast desk and the market east desk.  this next weekend the east is to be split into 12 different desks which will only complicate the issue even more.  russ severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll into one position manager.  is there any way that we get something similar from the reporting environment.  i m thinking that the easiest way might be to have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk first when submitting a report.  please let me know your thoughts on this. ,0,1,cpr reports

from the birmingham sunday mercury 7th jan 2001 worker dead at desk for 5 days bosses of a publishing firm are trying to work out why no one noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for five days before anyone asked if he was feeling okay.  george turklebaum 51 who had been employed as a proof reader at a new york firm for 30 years had a heart attack in the open plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  he quietly passed away on monday but nobody noticed until saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was still working during the weekend.  his boss elliot wachiaski said george was always the first guy in each morning and the last to leave at night so no one found it unusual that he was in the same position all that time and didn t say anything.  he was always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  a post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days after suffering a coronary.  ironically george was proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.  you may want to give your co workers a nudge or kick occasionally. ,2,-1,hey are you still breathing?

mike i received a voicemail from matt khourie tonight regarding the presenters.  apparently jeff s recollection that matt was to contact the presenters was inaccurate matt indicated that it had been agreed that you would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the sun demonstration.  with jeff out of town until monday i would really like to have someone contact the presenters before the end of the week.  is this going to be possible i ll call you tomorrow to follow up.  in the meantime below are the links to the presenters bios which i believe include their phone numbers.  let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  additionally i spoke to penny this morning regarding the number of rsvps we have to date.  i m very concerned about space and would like you guys to reconsider the buffet idea with seating scattered around the facility and the meeting room set up class room style.  if we go with the plated breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 10 tops there will be no space for a screen podium av equipment etc.  if we have more than 120 people i think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing to come in we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting room.  in talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the ypo group i ve been told that many ypoers do not show for the breakfast and will walk in just in time for the presentations.  i think you guys and jeff are scheduled to meet next tuesday so perhaps that can be discussed then. i ll give you a call tomorrow mike. ,1,2,contacting presenters

from pat arthur sent monday june 05 2000 9 15 am to 10 producers subject the u. s.  open golf tournament will be held at southern hills country club in tulsa next june 11 17.  with few exceptions the open is never held this far south thus making the event very accessible to those of us in the dallas area.  this will mark the 3rd open to be held at shcc. i ve been asked to assist in the corporate hospitality for the event.  because of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the world s preeminent sporting events.  to see it live to watch the drama unfold in person is an unforgettable moment.  this is one reason why companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package.  before i put the word out in the dallas market and they will sell out soon i wanted clients of mhbt to have the first shot.  i think this is a fair privilage the tickets to the event are sold out already so the only way to gain access is via a hospitality package.  they aren t cheap but the chance to have a u. s.  open so close might never happen again.  prices are from 28 500 to 150 000.  these prices range from a table in a furnished shared pavilion to an exclusive environment.  if you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and i will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated with each option.  these started to go on sale in the tulsa marketplace recently and several options are sold out including a few over 500 000. since demand is so high and space is limited i will hold off a week before making non mhbt clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime. take advantage of getting your best clients into the .  pat. ,0,2,2001 u.s. open

after continuing to play musical chairs with the west i think we have decided on a plan.   and  will handle the prompt and term basis.  this includes the monthly basis daily basis and gd index for sj rox scal cg and malin.  they will make certain that the gd index products are out there for all terms.  cary metz is managing the perm products. i will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the index points.  the term physical index will be coming soon. the rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the next day trading while adding the bom physical with a basis link to  s gd bom products.  i would like to get the cash products out on eol by 7 15 each morning.  the early info will come in handy as we approach winter.  let me know what you think.  steve and matt have started a pilot program in the nw for rolling out their next day cash products after 11 00 am each day.  we will look into rolling out the sw in the future. we are in the process of sending out the odd lot notice to our customers regarding all products on eol.  we will change our product minimum to one mmbtu in the next week.  you may want to discuss this with your direct customers before the mailout.  with the addition of olivia newton john to my scour selection it is no secret that we have a new commitment to physical in the west.  if you review your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven t contacted in some time then call them and visit.  we will be using eol and the brokers for physical volumes but nothing beats the direct phone call for the baseload phys. ,8,13,eol products

dear tom enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to discuss listing other index points at the border.  i think the market requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with respect to transportation constraints.  the market has clearly seen a divergence in the summer spreads between pg e and interconnects.  the marginal generation load in sp 15 and southern california this summer has proven that gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting daily demand with flowing supplies and will be incapable of injecting gas during these months.  because of this supply being transported from the southwest supply basins can only find a home going into pg e.  this places downward pressure on pg e topock gas and upward pressure on topock gas.  remember is an island not because of the delivered capacity to the border via epng and tw but because of the limited capacity of s interconnects.  demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity.  there is also a divergence between ehrenberg and topock because of liquidity.  topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport contracts on epng and downstream buying patterns of certain markets.  the market is more diversified at topock than ehrenberg.  the overwhelming demand pressure on gets exposed at topock.  although ehrenberg is the marginal point for gas into there is more of an imbalance in upstream capacity epng and tw to downstream capacity topock 545 000 d at topock than at ehrenberg.  the ehrenberg interconnect has 1. 1 bcf of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.  ehrenberg simply gets placed at market prices because of varying objectives.  one transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows while smaller buyers on may not approach this transporter for supplies.  this illiquidity has led to a spread existing between topock and ehrenberg.  picture the market san juan gas is trading well below the permian and waha basins which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west.  because of the of the limited capacity going into topock every transporter on epng and tw wants to fill their contracts with san juan gas first.  these molecules compete for buyers at a limited delivery interconnect.  likewise all buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery interconnect topock .  the san juan then trys to find an outlet going east on the sj east leg of epng.  this transport leg simply displaces permian gas going into plains north and allows permian gas to head west to ehrenberg on the epng south mainline.  while the market peaks in the summer so does the eoc demand.  permian west keystone west meter cannot satisfy both the eoc demand and the demand.  so for the first time ever we saw epng waha west at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the epng south mainline.  this tells the entire story.  when demand exceeds all available historical supply points and begins to reach to waha to meet ehrenberg demand you have a paradigm shift.  this eliminates any correlation that may have existed between the supply basins and the market area.  when keystone west reaches maximum capacity the rule of market spreads not exceeding the max rate transport rate then dies a fast death.  there is simply no available capacity at the keystone west meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate transport on epng and ship it to .  if you asked the market what the maximum interconnect capacity at keystone west is 9 out of 10 would not know.  this leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are above historical levels.  it is like al gore blaming big oil companies for the high prices of gas when all refineries are at maximum capacity.  there simply isn t the capacity to meet demand.  the supply exists but there isn t enough refining capacity available to meet demand.  fundamentals rule the market in all cases. i would like to propose the following index points for the southern california border.  the market would be better served with supply being included in these index points.  one ca production storage epng ehrenberg two topock tw and epng three krs wheeler ridge.  the market will be experiencing more changes with respect to the restructuring in the future.  we will then address the different interconnects and propose an index for the citygate as well.  call me on monday to discuss the enron online download. sincerely  director of west trading713 780 1022. ,34,40,socal

i have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and i think we need to discuss this in more detail.  i would like to continue to use the physical for large prompt positions going forward.  i am afraid that the baseload volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.  we need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.  i. e.  intra regional spreads with gd swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.  janie managing sj and laying off risk on steve s opal.  i know that the cash books would be a good idea for dailies but i am not sure how to do this without giving up the cash risk for baseload as well.  what are your thoughts i would also like to discuss the staffing issues.  matt smith and susan scott to analyst jay to the rox etc.  it seems like ken s.  has shown more interest in the west fundies lately.  should we keep his services the basis products need another book.  who can we add to the mix i think that we should look into having frank focus on prompt month only.  he has a great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing tight two ways for all products on the prompt.  keith can do term with another book. monique is going to take over the gd swaps for kern sj and perm.  i will continue to manage the ca products.  this should allow us to provide tighter two ways across the west.  i will continue to manage all index products and prompt month phys fixed price. operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.  the analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to nom the market. eol.  keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager s markets.  we should propose this to eol.  this would allow for tighter markets on all products and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers. ca cash products.  let s call a meeting about how to offer more socal physical products.  i would like to have pg e topock and socal ehrenberg before the summer. ,8,0,"cash books, etc."

hey guys.  let s try this.  take the data from 2000 and change the following.  take keystone west volumes to 850 000 d rateably then add the new gen numbers posted below.  you will need to add this demand to the eoc s ml demand numbers is salmayuca included in this number .  we should use the 2000 waha west volumes for now.  you should end up with reduced ehrenberg volumes for the reduction in keystone west volumes and the addition of new gen demand.  run the storage balance at 2000 socal in this scenario.  we will then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance socal in 2001.  also add columns to adjust etc the burns for new gen in sw.  we should then look to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro increased nw imports to ca scenario that could happen.  use the sp 15 2000 gen numbers and then back out the avg of 1999 and 2000 power imports.  i would like to avoid averaging 1999 and 2000 socal gas demand.  use a 10 000 heat rate to reduce gas demand.  have  adjust eoc demand for normal weather.  we may have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the sw electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 10 000 heat rate.  we will then be exposed to epng and the ops increasing keystone west volumes between now and next summer run the 2001 with this possibility as well.  take key west to 1. 1 bcf.  let me know where my errors in approach may be. this should give us a picture of the socal deliverability for 2001. ,0,-1,apr-oct analysis

i spent a little over 30 minutes with robert.  he is a very sharp guy and has a great deal of relevant government experience.  while i don t have a position that would be suitable for his experience level all of my senior positions are filled he is definitely someone i would consider if i had an open position. my impression from robert is that while he has some interest in public affairs his main interest is in a commercial position.  i stressed to him that it would be difficult to come into enron to run a business but he could build to it over time.  his main concern was that he not get lost in the system if he came in at a level below business unit head. i think robert would be a good addition to enron if 1 he is willing to come in to a commercial role at a more unior level to learn the system and 2 we can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels of the organization from time to time.    01 04 2001 09 08 am. ,0,3,feedback on robert mallett interview

mr.   the democratic senatorial campaign committee dscc and senators daschle murray wyden leahy bingaman kerry baucus carnahan durbin dorgan andschumer are hosting a series of discussions on the future of the new economyin beaver creek colorado on march 24 2001.  at this time we have about40 executives from venture capital communications and other high techbusinesses attending the conference.  most of those attendees joined thedscc s high technology council in 2000. the council was created last year in order to create a bridge betweendemocratic senators and key leaders of the new economy.  throughout 2000 wehosted dinners meetings and conferences that gave high tech leaders andsenators the opportunity to engage in an ongoing dialogue on the key issuesfacing the nation.  as a result the senators and participants in thecouncil were able to develop a solid understanding of the challenges facingboth government and business.  we hope that this effort has created afoundation for strong longterm relationships between the two groups. the conference in march is a continuation of last year s efforts but wewill focus on a few of the key issues facing the new economy to allow bothsides can drill down and gain a better understanding of some of theopportunities and problems we will face in the near future. in order to attend you would need to become a member of the dscc s hightech council by donating 25 000 to the dscc.  that would make you eligibleto participate in a series of events conferences and meetings this yearwith other industry leaders and democratic senators. i have attached an invitation to the event a registration form andinformation on becoming a member of the council.  we have reserved only asmall number of rooms for new members of the dscc s high tech council.  ifyou would like to attend please let me know as soon as possible and pleasedo not hesitate to contact me regarding any questions concerns or for moreinformation.  i can have a firm agenda to you in the very near future but iam waiting on some feedback from people like yourself regarding the issuesthey would like to discuss.  in your response please let me know if youhave any particular issues that are of concern to you. thank you very much for your time and consideration. doc. ,8,4,new economy conference with senate democrats

you had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from tom donahue regarding increasing enron s contribution to the to 100 000.  i have been giving the chamber a bit of a hard time lately and wanted you to know why. i have been in touch with both tom and his staff over the last year.  donahue has done a very good ob raising money and getting his membership rolls up both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  my reservation about the chamber is that they won t take a stand on something which is in the best interests of the vast maority of their membership if it will alienate a vocal few.  electric restructuring was a key example of this.  there was no doubt where they should have been on the issue but instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they decided to have a process .  naturally all the utilities volunteered to participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it came time to vote.  the vote supported wholesale but not retail reform with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery .  afterwards the federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation though this is not exclusively the chamber s fault . unfortunately tom s forceful and competitive approach when it comes to raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a few members will be upset.  for enron it s a bit like paying 100 000 for a veto right.  the only things the organization pushes for are the things everyone agrees on in the business community eg china pntr and lower corporate taxes things they will push for whether we pay dues or not and things we will add our separate voice to in any event .  as i have explained to the chamber enron makes its money challenging conventional wisdom changing the way markets work and dislocating incumbents.  anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some members of the business community and the chamber is unlikely to stand with us.  they represent the status quo in the business community.  tom is an extremely promising leader he needs to create a new kind of voice for the business community.  a voice which stands for moving business to the next level not ust protecting its current position. having said all that the chamber particularly its international chapters has been useful to us in the past.  in previous years donahue himself has intervened on our behalf with latin american leaders.  as a consequence i have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain chamber members at a lower dues and policy participation level but with continuing access to their international activities.  i suggested something in the 25 000 range.  that s why they are approaching you they want us to double our current dues to 100 000 . currently i am inclined to ust withdraw from chamber membership but i plan to defer to linda robertson.  i am interested in your insights or if you prefer you can simply refer them to linda or me. ,14,18,us chamber

steve it was great to meet you and hear your remarks yesterday.  for the speaking engagement next wednesday i would like you to focus upon the enron strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of energy development.  wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the commission is charged with the development and promotion of such.  but the governor s message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters in the traditional sense.  we will continue to have the status of a colony if we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are evolving.  if you set the stage with a presentation of enron strategy then we will discuss how a state with its agencies and auathority can play a role in this evolution.  i have set your time for 45 minutes which can include a short qand a period.  but your message can be as succint as you can make it and get the point across.  you may have to present the enron case a number of different ways but the governor will give you latitude to make the point.  you will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address role playing by the state and the commission.  plan to join us for lunch.  if you need more detail let me know. ,2,1,wyoming energy commission subject

dear mr.   enron being one of the extraordinary companies that has been able torestructure the corporation in an effective way and that still is underimportant business transformation is a subject of many interests.  thecurrent challenges are keeping company s management busy.  being aware ofthis i wanted to take liberty of asking if it would be possible to getsomeone of enron s top executive to contribute nokia s top executivedevelopment program.  we have invited a few external key note speakers toelaborate their company s transformation.  this kind of experience change hasproved to be beneficial for both parties.  also nokia s experiences have beenvaluable input in certain restructuring processes. this program called panorama is an annual top executive developmentprogram which takes about half a year in three modules.  in every year wehave nominated 35 participants to this intensive action.  the program targetis three folded give input to company s strategy development strengthenand integrate common understanding of company s direction and developleadership capacity.  the program owner is jorma ollila ceo of nokia. what are benefits from enron s point of view in the case we are able to getsomeone of enron s executives in the program i think that one of the mostimportant outcome of this kind of events is to open a dynamic networkingand discussion forum between our executives.  both parties could capitalizethis cooperation. in short we would appreciate very much if we could have your company spresentation in this panorama forum. looking forward to hearing from you yours  858 831 4877mobile 972 467 1453. ,0,-1,request for contribution

i agree with mark s points.  while we have advocated our merger with pge which did not concentrate market power we have intervened in opposition to most others.  moreover there is some hope that the german government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.  we will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.  most mergers in this industry are defensive not procompetitive and in my view deserve no credit for convergence innovation or liberlization. ,0,-1,speech to the british institute of energy economists

regional managerscompliance task forceas we discussed on the conference call on friday i have prepared a simpledraft letter of intent for the use of those regions who wish to indicatesupport for the regional compliance and enforcement program but are notyet in a position to sign the agreement for regional compliance andenforcement programs that the nerc board of trustees approved on february13. for the benefit of those who were not on the call i d like to recap wherethings stand at this point.  my apologies if i mischaracterize anyone sposition.  npcc and ercot have signed the agreement.  ecar has stated itwill sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on march 30.  spp isprepared to sign the agreement but doesn t want to be the only one it itspart of the eastern interconnection to do so.  frcc was not on the call but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at leastsix regions sign.  mapp and main have indicated that they prefer to developtheir program with their own members before they sign the nercagreement.  wscc may need to consider the matter at its board meeting inearly april.  serc has the matter under consideration.  i have not heardfrom maac but it has a meeting scheduling for march 29. i want to share with you my concern for the climate in washington.  in thepast few weeks i have had occasion to speak with a number of people oncapitol hill and in the new administration.  all are very concerned aboutwhat might happen this summer.  if a serious incident occurs i am quitesure that congress will legislate very quickly whether it will legislatewisely is a different question.  we have the opportunity with thisagreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny.  if congressacts it may well assign a very central role to the federal government totake direct responsibility for reliability.  there are those in thedepartment of energy who are pushing for such a role.  congressman bartonis talking of the possibility of emergency legislation possibly within thenext few weeks.  if the industry pulls together i believe we can forestalldirect governmental controls just as in 1965.  if the industry does notstep up then congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere. the ctg recommended to the board that a critical mass of six regions signonto the agreement before it goes forward.  for those regions that areconsidering developing their own programs with their members before theysign the agreement with the view of having the capg determine in advancewhether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement i ask you. ,0,22,compliance agreement

see below.  this is one of the issues that concerned us more than price caps because it could limit our ability to move power to other markets in the west. in addition if you get questions from the analysts on reregulation or price caps it is worth pointing out that the high prices prevailing in many markets help our retail sales pitch to end use customers and create opportunities for our wholesale price risk management services .  even a 250 price cap is 5 10 times what large customers are accustomed to paying. ,0,-1,great news ****ferc order on morgan stanley complaint against iso

i believe it is timely to discuss this again and i agree with  that stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission structural issues. i am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation but my gut reaction is that it would be a serious mistake.  congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation.  i think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at ferc and in other fora. i realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it.  if it gets through committee i have no confidence in this congress to actually amend it into something better and broader so again i have difficulty seeing why we should go that route. i look forward to the discussion.   enron07 17 2000 02 20 pm. ,0,1,stand-alone reliability legislation

enorous stupidity crisis.  californians have been sitting in the dark because .  they didn t turn the lights on. they say they re short of electricity.  yes they are.  between 1988 and 1998 california s electricity consuption increased by 15 percent.  eanwhile california s capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states power supplies.  californians didn t want das across their rivers derricks on their ocean power lines across their borders or fossil fuel soke in their sky.  these ight interfere with all the sart things californians do such as hangglide.  california was going to rely on negawatts draatic power conservation.  but california regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices and even californians weren t dub enough to skip a bargain.  and california was going to rely on alternative power generation.  with all the puffery fro silicon valley dot. startups wind fars wouldn t be a proble.  and doesn t gwyneth paltrow s star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel but it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative ostly to generating power.  californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables but they won t dig up the pretty lawn won t plant anything for fear of getting dirty and they use fragrant bath salts fro the body shop instead of selly copost.  let the ake their crudites with crab grass.  president bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring outofstate utilities to supply power to california.  and everyone is wrong to listen to californians whine about electricity deregulation.  there never was any deregulation.  the california public utilities coission erely changed its regulations which apparently weren t stupid enough to eet golden state standards.  under california s 1996 reregulation plan electric copanies sold their generating plants and becae distributors.  they were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot arket and forbidden to enter into any longter power supply contracts.  retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until arch 2002.  this is like requiring a p to sell you porterhouse at 2 a pound no atter what the price of beef on the hoof.  iagine how any steaks there would be and how any superarkets.  go to one of those boardedup grocery stores purchase a phanto tbone screw it into a ceiling fixture and try to light your house.  you re in california.  californians devised a syste of electricity sales that ignored every diension of the free arket.  interesting that the inforation econoy is centered in a place that s iune to inforation.  the free arket is a yardstick and californians got sacked with it.  ideast oil jitters cold weather natural gas price spikes and the plain unpredictable freedo of the free arket caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and california utilities to go 12 billion into the red.  california s governor gray davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain.  in a january 8 speech to the state legislature davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones.  he threatened to expropriate power generators and transission grids.  he called for laws to allow criinal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity fro california arkets.  and he said the state s universities and counity colleges would build cogenerating plants and becoe energy independent.  with gas produced by the cafeteria food gray davis sounded like joseph stalin with the iq of keanu reeves.  everyone should understand that there are other ore drastic easures that i a prepared to take if i have to davis declaied.  take is the key word.  grabby californians tried to regulate theselves into soe cheap electricity.  hoggish california power copanies went along because the stateiposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor.  according to the los angeles ties during the first 28 onths of the schee pacific gas and electric and california edison ade 20 billion fro the legally required arkup between wholesale and retail electric prices.  californians want to snatch that oney back.  consuer advocates around california.  said it did not atter that the utilities were returning investents to their shareholders reported the january 31 washington post.  they took the oney and ran said state senator john burton.  as opposed to californians who took the electricity and rollerbladed now the juice and the jack are both gone and the california legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing 10 billion to try to clean up the ess.  but the californians could still pull a sca.  the bill andates longter power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be.  the hope one guesses is that congress or the president or soebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower.  it would be wrong to call californians stupid.  they re sleazy too.  r j.  o rourke is the cato institute s h.  l.  encken research fellow and is foreign

bob vastine reports that robert madellin will be moving from the servicesportfolio this fall to agriculture and some other high soundingresponsibility.  he is being succeeded by herve jouanjean with michel servozas number 2.  does anyone have biographical information on hervejouanjean andrew buxton who heads the european services network will be here formeetings with csi and isacs this week and also in nyc with csi andjapaneese counterparts.  bob told me that vivendi is the only energyinterest involved as members of andrew s group and they have expressed nointerest in liberalized energy services.  this would seem to be anopportunity for the uk electricity association to advise him of theirinterests and possibly the drilling people. during the isac 13 meeting last week ustr  collins reported that thewto working party dealing with china s accession had expressed concern withthe recent negotiation in which the chineese won a series of exemptions andin the case of energy services and possibly e commerce there are pricecontrols.  we were told that a number of law firms in washington areopposing any ustr acceptance of this provision and bob vastine informedisac 13 members should they have a view on price controls. trade ministers will meet in september and are likely to ratify the chinaaccession regardless of the wto working group issues.  you need to let usknow if enron should consider filing a statement regarding price controlsfor energy services and e commerce services. joe. ,5,8,ec changes and related matters

the letter looks good.  a couple of comments for your consideration on page three we describe the change to the definition of public utility and then argue that we don t fit into it.  would it be worth explaining why that makes sense specifically the new ersey restructuring law like most efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power and gas businesses.  economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business eg distribution .  the competitive market can not be solely relied upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distribution utilities.  therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service.  what those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  the same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  the generation and sales business has a competitive structure i. e.  relatively low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc.  these components of the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates and terms of service.  they do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service.  because regulators don t set the prices and terms of service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations.  indeed the legislation and the legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. as a former practicing lawyer i certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative.  but i question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light which these documents have a habit of doing .  i can ust see the press seizing on enron s claim of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion .  i suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable esxercise of pd.  if we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public s resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances. ,3,9,request for legal advice.

processsee below.  federal price limits backfire 20 some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps 20 david lazarus chronicle staff writer wednesday uly 4 2001 20 2001 san francisco chronicle 20 url 20 http www. sfgate. com cgi bin article. cgi file 3d chronicle archive 2001 07 04 m n186091. dtl 20 officials in california and nevada after months of lobbying for federal 20 regulators to cap western power prices warned yesterday that the newly 20 imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat o f 20 blackouts in the two states.  20 the warnings were issued as california came within minutes of rolling 20 blackouts yesterday afternoon and one day after the first ever rolling 20 blackouts in las vegas forced energy hungry casinos to shut off fountains a nd 20 reduce air conditioning.  20 the two states are asking the federal energy regulatory commission to take a 20 closer look at the so called price mitigation plan and come up with revisio ns 20 that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during 20 shortages.  20 we need some clarity to this order said oscar hidalgo a spokesman for t he 20 california department of water resources which is spending billions of 20 dollars to keep the state s lights on.  20 generators need to be held accountable he said.  20 the crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet 20 power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below market rat es 20 during periods of high demand.  20 some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the 20 expense of shipping electricity from state to state.  each mile that 20 electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.  20 no one s going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said 20 gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum an 20 energy industry association in menlo park.  20 ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no 20 economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price control s 20 are in effect.  20 this means individual regions like california or las vegas could end up no t 20 having enough ackerman said.  it increases the threat of blackouts.  20 blackout alert canceled california authorities issued a blackout alert at 1 45 p. m.  yesterday when 20 power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels.  they canceled the alert 20 about an hour later after finding additional supplies.  20 everyone in the west is fighting for megawatts said stephanie mccorkle a 20 spokeswoman for the california independent system operator which oversees 20 the state s power network.  20 the golden state s latest brush with lights out conditions came a day after 20 nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting 20 heavy power users such as the mgm grand and caesars palace to dim their 20 lights.  20 don soderberg chairman of the nevada public utilities commission said tha t 20 the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they 20 are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in 20 exacerbating monday s shortage.  20 we re looking very closely at this he said.  there seems to be a potenti al 20 for unintended consequences.  20 specifically soderberg said nevada is focusing on operators of older less 20 efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishing 20 under capped prices.  20 we re going to see how the caps might have played into this he said.  20 the federal ceiling in 10 western states excluding california is about 9 2 20 per megawatt hour.  in california a 10 percent surcharge is added because o f 20 the state s credit risk bringing the price to ust over 101.  20 ackerman at the western power trading forum said regional price controls ha ve 20 extended california s power crisis to neighboring states.  20 california sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said.  20 lawyers looking for loopholes 20 california and nevada officials however said that they still have faith 20 that price limits can stabilize western electricity markets but that federa l 20 regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot 20 withhold output.  20 the generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan 20 said hidalgo at the department of water resources.  20 unfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue 20 that they took up only with the greatest reluctance.  for months federal 20 regulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let supp ly 20 and demand determine costs.  20 hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling bac k 20 on output monday california officials immediately dialed the hot line numb er 20 provided by the federal energy regulatory commission in case of emergencies .  20 no one answered he said.  they were closed.  20 state officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the 20 commission would look into the matter.  they were not given a time frame for 20 when the commission might come up with a response.  20 e mail david lazarus at dlazarus sfchronicle. com.  20 2001 san francisco chronicle page a 1 20 out of state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls by dale kasler bee staff writer published uly 3 2001 20 confused by the federal government s new controls on electricity prices 20 generators withheld so much power from california on monday that the state 20 was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts state officials said.  20 the confusion began when the state s electric grid operators declared a sta ge 20 1 power alert in the early afternoon triggering the price caps for the fir st 20 time since they went into effect une 21.  20 out of state generators pulled about 1 500 megawatts of electricity off the 20 table at midafternoon enough to power about 1. 1 million homes because of 20 uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new federal energy 20 regulatory commission pricing system said oscar hidalgo spokesperson for 20 the state department of water resources.  the department buys electricity fo r 20 the state s financially distressed utilities.  20 they didn t understand what they were going to be paid there was confusio n 20 over the ferc order hidalgo said.  we saw 1 500 megawatts disappear.  20 the problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the west which forced 20 california to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said.  20 rolling blackouts hit southern nevada.  20 most california officials credit the ferc system which is based on a 20 variable price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power 20 market.  but power generators have complained that the price caps by limiti ng 20 profits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.  20 and as monday s episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap 20 will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.  20 that s the risk that you run with price controls said arthur o donnell 20 editor of the newsletter california energy markets.  people want any kind o f 20 certainty at all.  20 hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last minute import s 20 from the bonne 0f ville power administration the federal agency that marke ts 20 government produced hydroelectric power in the pacific northwest.  the state 20 went into a stage 2 power alert the next to last level before blackouts ar e 20 ordered.  the alert was canceled in late afternoon.  20 the blackouts would have been the first in california since may 8.  20 ferc imposed a round the clock ceiling on power throughout the west.  the 20 price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least efficient 20 plant operating in california during a power alert declared by the 20 independent system operator which runs the state s power transmission grid .  20 when there s no alert prices can t exceed 85 percent of the cap that was 20 established during the latest alert.  20 until monday the maximum price held steady at about 101 a megawatt hour i n 20 california.  but when the iso declared a stage 1 power alert in early 20 afternoon signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 20 percent of demand confusion set in hidalgo and others said.  20 because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas which fuels many 20 california power plants suppliers knew the cap would fall.  but no one knew 20 by how much until the price was posted by the iso.  20 the ceiling for california fell to about 77 at 3 p. m.  but was back up to 98 20 in two hours according to the iso.  those prices include the 10 percent 20 premium that sellers can charge california because ferc said there s a cred it 20 risk in selling to the state.  20 o donnell said it s likely suppliers will pull back from the market every 20 time the iso declares a power alert.  20 in state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the iso.  bu t 20 out of state suppliers can withhold supplies and on monday it was the 20 out of staters that were pulling back hidalgo said.  20 the bee s dale kasler can be reached at 916 321 1066 or dkasler sacbee. co .  20

i think it s a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for bush.  i think the electricity section needs some additions though.  there is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines its largely a state and local decision.  further the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.  once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid.  the answer is open access so power can get from where it is to where it is needed.  this has been clear for a long time yet the current administration and its appointees on ferc have yet to use their. ,0,-1,fact sheet- latest draft

i thought i would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list of agreed apon tasks.  the unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we have huge business risk if it blows up.   and  are going to document the steps we are taking to maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds like it should be a high priority .  the database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.   is moving from sun o s to sun sularis which should allow us to address the problem.  we have 4 contractors working on this and we are expecting it to take 6 weeks.  once this proect is complete we can add hardware and reduce the e problems.  the traders need better real e management tools that ulately combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real e risk. tds was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the traders needs.  this ulately needs to be a system that is commissioned by the traders to meet their needs.    is going to prepare a list of trader needs in consultation with all the gas desks heads.  after this  should try to come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.  the power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  this is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.   has made progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.   t is going to put a plan together that meets with   s approval that addresses our needs with respect to all requirements deals and volume management deals in the east.  there will be no more business trips to london somewhat kidding .  portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their books through an interface with houston.    will talk to  beldon and  to determine whether its worthwile to put servers in portland.  since  was not in the meeting  will make sure we are covering all his needs. ,8,1,n.a. systems

tonywow i don t think so.  i thought i would rewrite yours and correct some of the factual errors.  if you disagree please write me back. i moved from our houston office in 1994 to calgary and in 1999 was named president of the canadian operation.  we went from a small gas marketing shop to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in canada.  it was absolutely awesome.  i had the time of my life.  we built the business with very little supervision from houston into a maor contributor to enron corp s bottom line.  these days as many people know we are using the same trading and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create liquid tradable markets in bandwidth pulp and paper coal and many others.  so our newer people still have the chance to do what i did in canada and help build revolutionary new businesses. what a lot of people don t realize is how dominant our trading and risk management presence is in natural gas and power.  the opportunities our outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  these businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage in montana to how to move power from new york to south caralina.  you can t put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commodities.  its not like trading bonds where you sit around and try to figure out what the fed is going to do.  it has much more complexity and if you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it. down here .  we need you  s callout quoteenron s not a place where you can hide.  if you can t get it done you won t fit in.  but if you can and you work hard you ll get noticed you ll excell you ll get paid and we re going to love you. ,14,-1,your blurb for the recruiting web site

below is a suary of the discussions last week regarding the coplaint against el paso for oversubscribing the socal topock point. the eeting started out by suarizing the dollar ipact of the border cuts to aoco and burlington of 3 illion dollars and the additional fuel costs of 15 illion that they have incurred when the ainline fuel was reduced and the gathering fuel was increased.  accordingly producers are seeking a iniu of 17 illion in copensation in soe for or another. the biggest concern is that a total of 1. 2 bcf day is being noinated at the socal topock which can only deliver 540000 btu day.  socal gas stated that this proble should go away when there syste becoes unbundled referred to as gatekeeper .  the proceeding is currently pending cpuc approval and could be ipleented as early as october 1 2001.  when the gatekeeper is ipleented only 540000 btu day will be accepted at the socal topock border and ust atch up with the intra state transport.  socal gas suggested taking the 1. 2 bcf day of noinations at the topock delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the capapcity 400 to ohave 540 to socal topock and 180 to pge topock.  they also stated they would accept less than 540 at topock but needed a iniu of 300 to eet core needs.  however they wanted soe type of copensation if their volue was reduced.  they also agreed to live with the status quo until the gatekeeper was ipleented.  this would result in fir rights being established at socal topock based on downstrea rights. willias owns block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a cd reduction or a reduced take requireent or use of alternate points with a rate adjustent. after uch discussion el paso cae back with the following counter proposal recoended interi solution until socal gatekeeper ipleented.  does not relate to receipt point rights.  block 1 capacity will always be alternate to socal topock 198000 . block ii capacity can not be sold at pge topock 614000 .  aoco and oneok each have a contract 45000 d which can go to topock or ehrenberg.  it is recoended that they give up their ehrenberg right and keep topock right and socal will give up like aount at topock as well as shift an additional 70000 btu day fro topock to ehrenberg resulting in approx.  115000 being shifted to ehrenberg.  rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows socal topock pge ohave topocktexaco 40 135burlington 26 74aero 5 15borax 7 12ladwp 0 36swgas 0 20.  socal topock would now be divided as follows expansion shippers 78000 socal gas 425000blk 3 348000 25 aoco 20 oneok 99 willias 189 el paso erchant 15 wllias total 851000540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput. the producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and felt that any transport sold after their sept 28 coplaint should be cut off the top which would be el paso erchant services blk 3. separate eetings were then held aongst the topock shippers to duscuss el paso s counter proposal.  producer group cae back and told el paso that they want the 63 percent thruput increased.  will accept cd reduction rate design change or other fors of copensation.  for the recoended volues oved to ohave pge topock they would consider a 30 percent reduction in cd deand as well as converting that path to a 100 voluetric rate.  in other words if the producers used the delivery point they would pay ax rate.  if they did not they would not pay anything. block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to socal topock if their deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor aybe 70 percent.  for volues shifted to non socal points they also want a 100 percent voluetric rate. botto line is how uch dollars is el paso willing to pay to resolve this case.  each party is requested to subit a proposal to el paso and they will study its entirety.  no follow up eeting was scheduled. another topic that was also being discussed at the eeting was the perceived gaing on the syste by the full requireents custoers ie noinating ore gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  it is thought that if this could be controlled there ay be ore certainty in the san juan regarding flows. ,0,15,el paso complaint

based on today s closing nymex prices there is 1. 9 mm of price difference between ecoelectrica s 2002 winter cargo commodity charge plus commodity surcharge and the delivered cost of 83 000 cbm of lng.  that is 5. 61 vs 4.  this assumes we pay a day rate of 50 000 day for the vessel jan 02 nymex is 5. 41 and the fob price for lng is 2.  let s stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into puerto rico in january.  as we discussed how we play this with cabot is a big issue.  there could be an additional 4. 7 mm of value that could be captured by eco if cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a winter cargo.  also let s continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we can get cabot s cooperation if needed. also note that eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the early spring cargo. ,1,11,ecoelectrica lng cargo in january 2002
the attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate eco s year end lng inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate days of outage for ct1 and number of cargoes diverted between now and year end.  simply enter your assumption for number of days of ct1 outage in cell a16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell a23.  the year end inventory is automatically calculated.  a negative number means that you require more lng than you are entitled to receive. assuming that you want the lng tank full at year end .  eco will be able to receive of the remaining 6 cargoes if the ct1 outage is 60 days or less.  175 days of ct1 outage are required to result in eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year end.  a 60 175 day outage for ct1 results in surplus lng but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 daysthe above figures assume a dispatch and availability on days that eco is not assumed to be in an outage. ,0,3,ecoelectrica lng requirements for remainder of 2001

i think the supplemental info you have provided is outstandin and helpful to the lenders in understandin the overall picture and the history.  however its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as i understand it.  the lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically about third party liability meanin i believe lawsuits or claims from parties who did not receive power because cuiaba failed to enerate.  therefore i think the questions which tozzinni needs to address are alon the lines of .  if epe is required to sin the areements by aneel what is the extent of damaes that could be claimed in the context of such areements .  could any consequential damaes be assessed .  could epe excuse itself from the leal proceedins on the basis of the bid documents the ppa or other areements with furnas electronote or eletrabras .  how would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judement which was payable by epe could the process be expedited to avert a liquidity crisis .  could epe be denied access to the rid as a result of failure to cover a spot market price assessed by the mae stemmin from an unscheduled outae .  similarly could epe incur penalties or be denied transmission if they failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of the areements .  will we need to sin the areements for other reasons such as access to back up power which would be excluded from the protections by furnas under the ppa .  could furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable by them or while they are awaitin word on a claims recoverability 10 a question for insurance does our business interuption insurance. ,0,-1,interconnection agreements

after eeting with larry joe hunter we will not be granting tagg access to his group.  they were wanting access to change deals that were booked to the wrong counterparty.  the proble here lies in that they were wanting to do these changes in the afternoon while we were calcing.  this is not an option. therefore the resolution is we are responsible for these corrections.  we ust get the deals entered into the syste with the correct counterparty initially.  our credit risk exposure is the botto line.  if we do not have all the deals to the right counterparty each day we ay not be receiving enough oney on letter of credit fro cp s.  fyi this is going to be a highly visible area for us to ake istakes.  if we continue to ake these istakes we as a group will catch severe fire.  to help us do this correctly bianca will be handing out a revised and updated counterparty list on a onthlly basis.  we will still have eails sent denoting cp nae changes i reccoend writing these down on your sheets to keep for future reference.  if all else fails and there is soething you are not sure about please call bianca ornelas at 5 3782. if you have any questions please give e a shout. ,1,5,counterparty names

bob shults called this meeting to see what the status was for the different product groups confirmation and gtc forms.  the two issues out of the meeting i was asked to bring to your attention were .  attaching the online gtc s to the outgoing confirmations.  per our discussion it was my understanding that the gtc s would be attached to all outgoing confirmations.  that does not seem to be the general consensus.  there seems to be feedback from london that is not the case and janice moore was also saying she didn t know if that s what the liquids people were going to do.  bob shults asked for your direction with these holdouts.  the issue of the credit in the masters being overriden.  first after our discussions yesterday we couldn t figure out a way they could change the approval status within credit from approved with a master to a b approved gtc with credit.  second bob shults thought that had been agreed to have the credit overridefor all the product areas and i told him that financial was still discussing this issue with credit so we would have to get back to him.  i guess the physical people are ok with that.  i don t know what discussions you have had with jeff and alan but bob shults appears to want to have this confirmed for him. also along with the credit override of the master there is supposed to be some letter that will be sent out to the counterparties.  who will be drafting that letter and will it be the same for all product groups. ,0,1,online confirmation meeting

it has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for master swap agreements only.  having other documents listed in that section may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general trading purposes such as global contracts.  that is why we created the other agreements section to house these other agreements.  my understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the master swap agreements section is that they have been done so erroneously.  the drop down were not created too artfully created allowing wrong agreements to be put in master swap agreements which has been proliferating.  if my understanding is not correct than when did the intentional use of that first section change i think putting all agreement is a very bad idea.    03 14 01 05 35 pm. ,0,-1,jp morgan securities inc.

linda and i had a good visit sunday for about six hours.  we had a nice lunch at an outdoor cafe went shopping in the village and then went back to my house for a chat.  linda had pictures of jenny.  she is a beautiful 14 year old blond like linda but with tim s dark eyes and full eyebrows.  she was voted the 1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class and linda was a little concerned about that because jenny is a little developed for her age group and she s afraid the boys interest is a little prurient.  her marriage is going well despite steve s current unemployed status.  but she is doing well in her job they moved into a bigger house and tim bought her old one and all in all is at a very good place in her life.  i m getting ready to leave for new orleans tomorrow for our legal conference.  we have dinner reservations at emeril s for 9 00 tomorrow night and we re all a bit excited about that.  then thursday night is our big night out at a blues club. this email was a good idea.  linda got my address and i hope to be chatting with her more than every two years i ll be in touch when i get back.  all my love. ,0,-1,mission successful

i reviewed the counterparties in our financial trading database and located 17 who cannot enter into financial power transactions and cross checked that list against my online trading counterparty list and located the 6 counterparties below have been opened to trade online and who cannot trade financial power and or who have some type of restriction in place on the type of financial power transactions they can enter into .  the bakersfield californian can only do newsprint swaps and options.  cms marketing services and trading can enter into financial power transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps basis swaps swing swaps and options.  phibro inc.  can only do natural gas crude oil or oil product energy prices swap put call options.  per my discussions with  this counterparty is coming through on tonight s list as an amended counterparty because they want to do financial power.  they have a really old form of agreement in place from 1993 and it does not allow power financial transactions.  i spoke to mark taylor about this and he said if they want to do financial power they are going to have to replace this agreement with an isda.  i am going to talk to credit about this.  they will definitely not be able to trade financial power by monday.  pxre corporation weather only.  swiss re financial products corporation weather only.  tempest reinsurance company limited weather only. ,0,2,enrononline - financial power trading

mark taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your isda masters inputted into our financial trading database.  this databse is the central master database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft form or that have been executed.  london currently updates this database to manage its and singapore s financial contracts and i would like to get the australian agreements plugged into the system. this database serves a number of purposes.  first it is our core memory of contract negotiations.  anyone in legal and credit around the world can take a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  it is critical as we become a global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take on these financial contracts.  for instance it would be quite problematic if someone in houston was negotiating a contract with an isda counterparty and asserted that a certain position was critical if we find out a lawyer in another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the same position the day before.  we need to make a somewhat coordinated effort on the counterparty front. in addition with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database. further we use the information in the database to respond to inside auditing reporting and insurance inquiries. for online trading i check the database to see if we have a financial master agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place.  global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract records and approval for online trading. for both houston and london we use the database to communicate with our clients whether traders or back office support people.  employees outside legal have limited view access only to see all the information except the confidential legal and credit comments.  they have no edit capabilities.  the database also has some reporting functions that we and london legal have found helpful. you should have gotten my email to mike neves out database coordinator requesting full edit access for you.  it usually takes a few days.  once you get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database and we can figure out how to get your isda data inputted. are you coming to the ena legal conference in october that would be a good time for me to do a full review of this database with you. ,11,0,financial trading legal database

john it s good to hear from you a few things on your paralegal friend.  first we don t currently have any openings though we have tended to hire paralegals with a lot of experience.  most of the paralegals in our group have about 15 25 years experience.  also we recently hired someone and i don t anticipe us hiring for awhile. most of  s litigion work is done out of  corp.  they do have a big litigion group up there and th would be the most obvious place to start.  chuck cheek is the head lawyer for th group.  you could forward her resume up there with a note it might get it more personal tention.  also keep wching or she can wch it online the job bank they advertise paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the  companies. another group th might be interested in hiring paralegals and might hire paralegals with less experience is the global contracts group headed up by mary solmonson.  they re always looking for people and it might be a good way for your friend to get her foot in the door  ect.  also if her undergradue degree was in business obviously she might have some more options in other groups. as far as running goes i m trying to get back into shape.  i m just surviving 3 miles around the park and this weekend i plan to double my mileage to 6.  it sounds like we re both not in fighting form.  but i do want to start training in july with houston fit for the houston marhon again. ,0,-1,tana!

attached is the consolidated list of counterparties for the week ending 12 3.  all other lists sent to you by various people this week can be ignored.  if a counterpartys says declined by credit you don t need to look at it.  if there is nothing in the box it means approved and as of today look at divisions which means they are trading out of a division the division issue is up in the air and is being looked at on a going forward basis. per my agreeement with each of the physical groups if i do not hear from you in one day i will assume the counterparty is approved to trade all the products that credit has approved for that counterparty.  we rarely expect counterparty issues from the physical trading groups most of the counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.  i only need to hear from you if you have a problem with a counterparty. most of the physical trading group s issues will revolve around which contract to use and that should be resolved directly with global contracts in the same way you resolve such issues on an off line basis. credit is redoing the 12 6 and 12 7 lists they sent to me earlier and i will forward them to you as soon as i receive them. ,0,8,eol credit approvals week ending 12/3

bob and  here are the versions of the mou your lawyer will need to review.  as expected some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a change.  specifically an actual date for the released product will not go on the mou.  customers who particpate in the jdp have a high degree of touch and disclosure with ms.  although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning though this hardly matters now considering the date .  the line in 4 that was cut and pasted to 17 has been placed back in 4.  this is due to the placement of the topic in 4.  the rest of 17 specifically stating that there is no cost to the customer has been left in on 17 and i ll probably incorporate this for future use.  it is a good addition.  10 on microsoft s section has been removed.  it is clearly rednundant and not necessary.  we already say there is absolutely no cost to the customer.  if this is agreeable i have included the red lined version so your lawyers can review the final version with those changes have also been included.  please print sign and return. ,0,-1,nan

i am actually working on the pieces of the project but the overall system still needs to be designed.  i ve been working with our computer people to upgrade our master swap agreement .  we will be capturing some additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the autoconfirm process.  then once we work out confidentiality issues relating to our comments section and different companies we will be opening the to all interested ena employees.  i ve developed two new s we re currently working the kinks out of.  first is our jurisdictional which will summarize the swap laws as they relate to each country.  our international business is growing and its becoming imperative that we get this up and going.  i ve actually got the designed we re working some kinks out and i hope lawyers can start briefing the country information soon. of course the compelling project for us over the last 6 9 months has been online trading.  i was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract information.  with thousands of counterparties being approved initially and on a ongoing basis we needed a to keep track of which counterparties we have approved or disapproved and tie each product to a contract.  we have that system ready now and i am finishing having the data inputted. the other part of the system will be our library of research memoranda legal advice etc.  this will be a cross product library financial physical power etc .  i think i am going to dupe a the european office has in place to create ours.  the major complaint i have heard from some of them is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they want them.  so i ve got to create a lawyer user friendly index.  among other documents this is i think where our forms might reside in addition all the research and advice on various legal issues we ve received from outside counsel as well as isda netting opinions and the like.  i think this library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being scanned into and kept.  i think we can buy a scanner that will scan the documents in then the web is already set up so we can have our documents available around the world.  so the setup for this might go quickly although compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might be more of a problem. the last part we ve got to develop is the then overall place or site for all these various s.  so i think necessity has made me develop the pieces before the overall system.  maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this. ,11,-1,database

there is no documentation to evidence this it is an operation of law.  being a legal incorporated entity means you are embodied as a legal entity after filing or creating certain organizational documents under state or federal laws you could be a corporation partnership governmental entity or other type of entity .  a division is not a separate legal incorporated entity.  it is one and the same entity as the incorporated entity.  it is a dba which means doing business as or assumed name for an incorporated entity.  any division of an incorporated entity can and usually should trade under the same master as the incorporated entity unless the company gives us some reason elsewise .  frequently the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being aggregated. is why we always want the name of the incorporated entity as part of the counterparty name when we transact with a division.  examples might be   inc.  acting through its tlj company division or   inc.  d b a tlj company or tlj company a division of   inc.  frequently the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same and we may have to talk to them or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being aggregated with the corporate entity.  legal and or credit should direct you when a division should trade under the legal entity s master. s.  susan flynn is on an extended leave of absence.    07 20 2000 05 36 pm. ,0,-1,clarification of cargill issue

i believe that this was authored by james carville new york ap the new york mets announced today that they are going tocourt to get an additional inning added to the end of game 5 of the worldseries.  the batting pitching and bench coaches for the mets held a pressconference earlier today.  they were joined by members of the major leagueplayers union.  we meant to hit those pitches from the yankee pitchers said the mets batting coach.  we were confused by the irregularities of thepitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit.  one claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the mets batters hadintended to swing at fast balls but actually swung at curve balls.  it wasclear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls though amuch higher percentage were not confused by the pitches.  reporters at thepress conference pointed out that the mets had extensively reviewed film ofthe yankees pitchers prior to the world series and had in fact faced theyankees in inter league play earlier in the year.  the fact remains thatsome of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit said the metsbatting coach.  the world series is not over yet and the yankees arecelebrating prematurely.  major league baseball has reviewed the telecast ofall the world series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by theumpires of each game.  while some of the strikes called against the metswere in fact balls there were not enough of them to change the outcome ofthe world series the commissioner said.  another portion of the mets legalclaim stated that based on on base percentage the mets had actually wonthe world series regardless of the final scores of the games.  it s clear that we were slightly on base more often than the yankees saida mets spokesman.  the world series crown is rightly ours.  the manager ofthe mets has remained in relative seclusion engaging in some light joggingfor exercise.  he has stated that he believes we need to let the processrun its course without a rush to judgment. ,7,9,world series in question

i got back from vacation late friday.  our whole group got bumped from the flight in paris so they paid us 700 each to take the next flight out.  not a bad deal but it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and i was exhausted.  luckily it was a 3 day weekend here so i had time to recover and clean from my construction work . i had a really nice time.  most of our time we spent in east germany except for the flight out of munich.  we went to berlin leipzig eisenach wittenberg erfurt potsdam and hiked in the harz mountains.  my favorite time was the time spent in kitzbuhl austria.  it was wonderful i hope to make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.  it is so hard to do anything like it in houston i forget how nice the mountains can be.  our hotel was great smack in the middle of town and it only cost 30 breakfast and dinner included such a deal i got home and my house is almost done.  there are only a few minor things left.  the garden is at .  my landscaper had a big fight with my tenant while i was gone so she wouldn t come to my house until i got back. i ve picked out my two new kitties and i ll pick them up this weekend i think if the painter is done .  they are calico cats.  i haven t named them yet. what s going on with you are they working you to death any fun things going on. ,0,13,i'm back...

i would like to send the email out announcing this master and have a few questions.  first about the approved products as best as i can determine we don t have the pulp paper language in and don t have the weather rep in.  seeing as tho they probably won t trade pulp paper i won t worry about that.  however with respect to weather since the weather rep is always added into the confirm i don t think not having it in the master would necessarily mean they can t trade weather.  unless you know of a reason to the contrary i would think we want to open them for weather. second looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to mention to the general distribution group i don t see anything in particular out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues except in the netting of payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst pg e and it core procurement department and california gas transmission department.  will they be financially trading separately under those departments and if so should we instruct the settlements group to net the payments anything else special you think i need to mention. ,5,-1,pacific gas & electric

louis fernandez was wonderful to work with.  his work was top notch his subcontractors did a great job.  for instance i put in central air and one of the old window units we took out was in the brick in front of my house.  i thought when the brick got repaired i would have this mismatched brick box they would look ugly from the front.  louis s brick guy was so good that you cannot even tell the brick was repaired.  also his sheetrock guy did a wonderful job.  you cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes. louis is also a good businessman.  he gives you a weekly bill spelling out the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing any supplies he was billing you for.  a lot of contractors are not good businessmen.  i think louis is honest about the time it will take to do a job he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the cost and i also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a lot of add ons they ask of the contractor that they don t figure in his additional time or money on.  to sum it up i think with louis you will get a good job for the money you pay. ,0,-1,reference

at the request of sara shackleton i am attaching my list of north america utility counterparties.  my given task when i compiled this list was to identify utilities and determine if there was a reason we should not approve online trading for the counterparty.  we originally denied approval for all utilities unless we had a master agreement in place or an overriding commercial reason to transact.  we are now taking the position that investor owned utilities ious and related corporate entities should be approved for trading.  however we will not approve online trading for governmentals or cooperatives when we do not have a master in place so those counterparties identified as such do not need to be included in your review.  obviously if you are aware of a municipal or cooperative i failed to detect please let us know.  in addition your review does not need to extend to the canadian counterparties.  we will run those by canadian counsel. please review the list to help us identify the ious.  you may ignore the approved for trading column. for your information the list was compiled from information provided from our credit department from the company s financial statements which i obtained from edgar from the company s web site from www. utilityconnection. com or from web searches of the company when i could not locate information from any of the other sources. please give us a call tomorrow to discuss briefly. ,0,1,utility counterparty list

below is the standard information we always have in every email when we get a master swap agreement executed.  with this email global counterparty can open the counterparty.  we then immediately send the master swap agreement and other documentation down in the attached memo.  if we get the master in signed but we re waiting on critical additional documentation like the guaranty or perhaps a legal opinion on a governmental we hold off on sending the email.  sometimes the file may not be complete because we are waiting on incumbency certificates which we do not consider critical in most circumstances so we may send the email send down whatever executed documentation we have while we wait on the certificates.  we used to wait to send the executed documents down until we had the whole package completed but they can t approve the counterparty without getting the master.  does this make sense . i am now going to look for one with special instructions. below is my standard memo to global contract with any kind of executed documents i send down to them.  also a new procedral thing that is evolving here in houston we used to send global contracts the originally executed guarantees but credit is not the gatekeeper and recordkeeper of all guarantees so we will be sending the originals to them in the future with a copy in the global contract file. ,0,-1,the tranzonic companies

each legal trading group here in houston checks on a relevant counterparty s ability to trade its products.  so far the only physical trading area where a governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained to trade power.  for financial trading we do have to inquire into the relevant governmental entities authority to enter into derivative transactions.  in order to do that we look at statutory authority any relevant local regulations investment policities etc.  in addition to obtaining legal opinions on the subject and with some counterparties hiring outside counsel to advise us.  for most governmental entities if we do not have an isda master in place and have already done such due diligence i will not be approving them to trade financial products. as far as the financial test for the us based counterparty list i check with credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the us eligible swap participant standards.  as i m sure you know for most plain vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of 10mm or a net worth of 1mm.  pretty much if i am turning down a counterparty to trade financial it will be because they do not meet the esp test or they are a governmental or quasi governmental entity. if what you are telling me is that the australian counterparties have to meet a 6mm asset test to trade any products then i will add this to my daily inquiry to credit and turn down australian counterparties if they do not meet this test.  at your direction i will handle this in this manner.  how would you like me to proceed   enron development 08 16 2000 07 58 pm. ,6,8,eol credit responses 08/14/00

the email that you sent me last thursday has bothered me the entire weekend.  that is why i am emailing you from home.  i just want you to know my true intention of the email i sent you that day.  first and foremost i invited you and kenny out for drinks or a dinner as friends.  i repeat as friends and nothing more.  i said in that email that business does not have to be discussed and i meant it.  as far as the enron natsource deal that you are talking about. had nothing to do with the email i sent you.  as far as i know that deal has been in the works since september october between jack cogan and andy zipper.  so i want it to be clear to you that the deal had nothing to do with me sending you that email.  as a matter of fact the reason why i sent you that email and invited you out was because of the last time we spoke.  remember when i instant messaged you the reason why i approached you that way was because i thought we were close enough friends that i could.  as i found out i was wrong.  however when i spoke to you that day on the phone and asked if i could ask you out in the future when i come to houston . said i could.  i have planned to come down for weeks.  even though you choose to not deal with natsource i still considered you a friend and thought it would be appropriate to ask you out. so i did.  as you know i take things to heart.  i was really upset with the response i got from you.  i am emailing you from home because it bothered me so much that i needed to make sure you understood my true intentions.  i hope i have done that.  finally i just want to say that i will not bother you again.  i just want you to know that i have always tried to do the right thing.  i feel as though you are questioning everything i say or do and that you believe there are ulterior motives behind my actions. it just isn t true with that i wish nothing but good things for you and your family.  good bye ray. ,10,18,please take time to read
